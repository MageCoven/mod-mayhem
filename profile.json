This Minecraft mod is written for\nthe Fabric & Quilt mod loaders for modern versions of Minecraft (1.18.2+) - Changes tend to focus on making it more\nextendable, as well as improving compatibility with other mods. Improvements to older features are also being sprinkled\nin from time to time.\n\nThis mod's official project pages can be found below:\n\n- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/grappling-hook-mod-fabric)\n- [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grappling-hook-restitched) \n\nFabric compatibility *comes first* due to its current adoption in the Minecraft Modding community, however Quilt is\nsupported by the mod currently! In the case that either Mod Loader encounters a problem, make sure to\n[submit a bug report!](https://github.com/squeeglii/grapplemod-restitched)\n\n\n\n## üîó Origins\n\nThis repository is an unofficial fork of Yyon's [Grappling Hook Mod](https://github.com/yyon/grapplemod), which was \nwritten to support the Forge mod loader. It has a history stretching back all the way to its MCreator roots in 2015,\nimplementing improved physics, upgrades, and better integrations since.\n\nYou can find the links to its official project pages (and the downloads) here:\n\n- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/grappling-hook-mod/versions)\n- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grappling-hook-mod) (More up-to-date? Last checked 19/6/23)\n\nThis fork's root stems from the 1.19.2 version of v13, created under the original scope of providing an alternative\nunder the Fabric & Quilt ecosystems, as well as updating these ports to future versions. With the original scope met,\nfuture versions now focus on enhancements on top of the original work, as well as perpetual support into the future.\n\n\n## ‚òéÔ∏è Contact\n\n- **Discord:** [Support Server or](https://discord.gg/94c45XagEH) @CG360\n- **GitHub:** [/squeeglii](https://github.com/squeeglii)\n\n\n## üìú Credits:\n\nSee [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](/ATTRIBUTIONS.md) for credits with attached licenses, such as for sounds and code.\nThere are some smaller credits also found on [the original Forge repository!](https://github.com/yyon/grapplemod/)\nwhich have been omitted here.\n\n### Technical Contributions\n\n- **Original Mod** - Yyon\n- **Textures** - Mayesnake\n- **Forge 1.18+** - Nyfaria\n- **Fabric/Quilt 1.18.2+** - CG360\n\n### Translations\n\n- **Russian** - Blueberryy\n- **French** - Neerwan\n- **Brazilian Portuguese** - Eufranio\n\n\n\n\n--- \n\n# Contributing\n\nPull Requests and Issues are always welcome!

[Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com/partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-05-25T20:34:39.856745Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":6617075,"followers":5036,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ","l1SLPhB6","bpznplxY","sXviAk4G","SLiFyIon","bketoxVs","frGGaFrx","gO8hxcyv","ugIRhLoi","2LyjkgAv","PG8gMKcT","4Nq7hEtl","hyejM5za","SzEdoick","UHcskdEO","92bPVm5F"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"frGGaFrx","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.5-1.20.1 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.5","changelog":"## Changes\r\n* Backport latest build down to 1.20.1\r\n* Fix \"ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\" sometimes showing up in logs\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.4-1.20.6...1.6.5","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-25T20:34:05.225978Z","downloads":44392,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"00009f1762657d252fba9ac42d67f29376ec3e3082befebeba4a8d1635fd71f76f309ed766fa36d407213357d2f21ab6dc26cbe44ddac9d636cca9896a02111d","sha1":"3a671efcdd85c431c933b84868373afd05b5fc16"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/frGGaFrx/entityculling-fabric-1.6.5-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-fabric-1.6.5-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":64981,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"poie5Iwy","username":"vicisacat","name":"vicisacat","avatar_url":null,"bio":"I made the Entity Culling port for beta 1.7.3 and that's it.

populates some item, block and other tags (for mod compatibility)","body":"This is a purely technical mod with the aim to increase inter-mod compatibility. By \"purely technical\" I mean that it won't add any content to your game.\n\n### The Problem\n\nMod creators are encouraged to use tags where possible, e.g. when creating a recipe. If mods are supposed to work together though, they should all share a same base of common \"conventional\" tags, which group certain items together. Not all developers add their items to common tags though, which means that a person playing with many mods or a mod pack creator might need to create long lists of all items which fulfill certain criteria to add them to specific tags.\n\n### The Solution\n\nUpon loading a world, this mod will automatically populate some tags based on code conditions, covering all modded content as well.\n\nIt's mostly relevant for mod pack creators who need / want to configure mods by adding to specific tags - this allows them to e.g. easily add all armor items to a tag, because they'll all be bundled in `c:armor`.\n\nAs another example, all items which are equippable in the head slot will land in a tag called `c:head_equippables`:\n\n![Screenshot of the `c:head_equippables` tag](https://i.imgur.com/2E36FZS.png)\n \n\n### Additional Information\n\nFor an overview of the tags the mod currently adds, as well as the blacklist option via datapacks, [view the README on GitHub](https://github.com/apace100/autotag/blob/1.18/README.md).\n\nIf you have any suggestions for new tags, feel free to post them in the comments or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/apace100/autotag/issues)!\n\n\n\nI hope this mod helps someone and makes their life a bit easier. :)\n\n----\n\nThe mod icon is a composition of modified icons created by Lorc and Delapouite, found on game-icons.net.","published":"2022-04-27T08:43:12.453767Z","updated":"2023-07-07T18:57:46.548975Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":338872,"followers":70,"categories":["library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["zTLVD3Ir","iLNm8Z6p","50kM3UvN","VoyNngbb","sXJE2Hnq","cC57ynct","ocD9XA8D"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8FdYDHF5/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ocD9XA8D","project_id":"8FdYDHF5","author_id":"g6LkRuia","featured":true,"name":"1.20: AutoTag 2.0.2","version_number":"2.0.2+1.20","changelog":"Updated to 1.20 and 1.20.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-07T18:57:47.526842Z","downloads":243036,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"86b27da622ca4d5003e2c78c9da91468fde31e6d57af92e3f346403935818b6b1f02f16114ff11fc635a2f6b7511003c37141fb947d9d8537805b7deff2bbd5d","sha1":"78183b1e5513c6b6d8bf5477b0cda9d8f86268c4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8FdYDHF5/versions/ocD9XA8D/autotag-2.0.2%2B1.20.jar","filename":"autotag-2.0.2+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":52660,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"3bce310bba19e53e5958d1b6449115742af0c329","sha512":"88834ff7cf41166dd8525f16351056d78e5f78f6a2dbd9fdaa35ed8e7a31a7c4126ae734a3a6c5e79e8fec02e55f04b5b3a01364681acf276edcd1ce6612b52f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8FdYDHF5/versions/ocD9XA8D/autotag-2.0.2%2B1.20-sources.jar","filename":"autotag-2.0.2+1.20-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":22444,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"CuOWTsQ5","user":{"id":"G41cEWi2","username":"will_bl","name":"Will BL","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5115825?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-31T22:16:53.367206Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"CuOWTsQ5","user":{"id":"g6LkRuia","username":"Apace","name":"Apace","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/49096778?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-08T00:10:08.362286Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"autotag-2.0.2+1.20.jar"},"mods\\eureka-1201-1.5.1-beta.3.jar":{"sha512":"614b47e312cf7a8d2aaa6f005e805a3ca35347123552d442d3b4d36ac3304bda2a85ef3823300eae0d6b66e35a10f0345ac44654bea6bd24a0e1be78196f2869","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"EO8aSHxh","slug":"eureka","project_type":"mod","team":"Iteupxjr","title":"Eureka!

Originally it was a part of [Pufferfish's Skills](https://modrinth.com/mod/skills) mod, but was split and now can be used independently.\n\n## Attributes\n\nSome attributes work different from vanilla ones. Instead of providing a value they modify dynamic values using addition or multiplication. For example damage dealt by attacking using various weapons. They work like normal attributes, but their base value is internally set to the dynamic value. Changing base value of these attributes is not possible, because it is permanently set to [NaN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN). These attributes are marked as dynamic in their description below.\n\n- Stamina\n- Melee Damage\n- Ranged damage\n- Fortune\n- Healing\n- Jump\n- Resistance\n- Mining Speed\n- Sprinting Speed\n- Knockback\n\n### Stamina\n\nAttribute `puffish_attributes:player.stamina` allows to change hard coded stamina value, which is 4 by default. Stamina determines how much exhaustion player must collect to decrease food/saturation points.\n\n### Melee Damage\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.melee_damage` modifies damage dealt using melee weapons.\n\n### Ranged damage\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.ranged_damage` modifies damage dealt using ranged weapons.\n\n### Fortune\n\nDynamic attribute  `puffish_attributes:player.fortune` modifies fortune when mining a block, also applies without having fortune enchant on the item.\n\n### Healing\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.healing` modifies how much health is restored by natural regeneration.\n\n### Jump\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.jump` modifies how high player can jump.\n\n### Resistance\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.resistance` modifies resistance of the player\n\n### Mining Speed\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.mining_speed` modifies mining speed of the player.\n\n### Sprinting Speed\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.sprinting_speed` modifies sprinting speed of the player.\n\n### Knockback\n\nDynamic attribute `puffish_attributes:player.knockback` modifies knockback power of the player.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric. It may conflict with other mods that add similar attributes. Please report an issue if you find an incompatibility.\n\n**It is incompatibility with every version below 0.12.0 of Pufferfish's Skills, because that versions includes everything that Pufferfish's Attributes adds. However, version 0.12.0 of Pufferfish's Skills, when released, will no longer contain Pufferfish's Attributes, therefore these mods will be compatible.**\n\n## Versions\n\nVersions that are maintained and will receive future updates are: 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.19.4, 1.20, 1.20.2, 1.20.4.\n\n## Modpacks\n\nYou can use this mod in your modpack as long as you do not redistribute this mod.","published":"2024-03-28T19:41:07.521172Z","updated":"2024-06-02T17:23:01.276929Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":9273,"followers":15,"categories":["game-mechanics","library","utility"],"additional_categories":["management"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["vjyrgZ4t","aEXrd6Gk","akYwrf2x","OwpspM8j","q1YNYX46","HtTHEvn5","2jVaBWQQ","KiBBrgIr","aowYX1Ng","w8DsSlyJ","kLlwnjhn","OMRHNS0p","eOzlYeYS","jZ6clufT","2mtm3wlX","7ZCWortj","1RMeTDan","RYphekww","TouzHJRA","89goX9JR","Zs11lNLI","mRqyVmZg","Hv1gf4f7","FWcjGg1K","tgtUFpm3","LfFhx9Iy","fQadECPH","uIfUdSKo","i8zbWbtl","AeGH5WvW","BeCYfSDL"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FCFcFw09/f25e0000aca9f043997af84f44d33099f7c6b8ef.png"},"version":{"id":"kLlwnjhn","project_id":"FCFcFw09","author_id":"3fJOgX88","featured":false,"name":"Pufferfish's

Tweaks","description":"Enhances inventory management by adding various functions to the mouse buttons. ","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-05-12T16:27:48.472824Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1785273,"followers":1774,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL","1n3YehcE","nWbxhour","7JVXOe3K"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"mjuG4AYd","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20‚Äì1.20.4 Fabric] Mouse Tweaks 2.26","version_number":"1.20-2.26-fabric","changelog":"- Improved compatibility with slots with custom stack limits (like in the Nether Chested mod).","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-02T16:59:36.217330Z","downloads":193745,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d0faf200dda358efddad2d2809f646023f4dd06254572369e07f3bf33cb6941f0fcdb02db4675b30b4f3bd542cbf6196e135680ba91a2b74c2b071f34978e2d5","sha1":"6a6b977e671b1ab625e740fc70fb5300c21bb841"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/mjuG4AYd/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar","primary":true,"size":77943,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"92e908a8ac714509904a6b484a24c68a43569a28a4a2800d9ea1144c8de9476363707e40c7eb3739712a0c94312b244f014f8114ca83b668b55a4b7164f56abf","sha1":"42f757f20c9437f93aa9aa912519231db91e961c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/mjuG4AYd/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26-sources.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":65765,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar"},"mods\\FarmersDelight-1.20.1-2.1.1+refabricated.jar":{"sha512":"f31a606f861afedd4d265e7150535519fe3d40d5a418769630897c38a41a64d767fe236167832760593700986706dab6f9f4979cbe5f6a0bad0fcd1323971573","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"7vxePowz","slug":"farmers-delight-refabricated","project_type":"mod","team":"w0r2K7UT","title":"Farmer's Delight Refabricated","description":"Modern Fabric port of the cooking and farming mod, \"Farmer's Delight\"","body":"![Farmer's Delight Refabricated Logo](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/55f4eef09b087d3b08a792e1c7c224e5796cbb71.png)\n\n## This is an unofficial Fabric port of vectorwing's Farmer's Delight.

Just press left click when cooking anything on a skillet or use a shovel on a placed down one!\n\n**üåΩ Description**\n\n**Farmer's Delight** is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.\n\nUsing a simple cooking system and a few familiar ingredients, you'll be able to prepare a wide variety of hearty meals: from sandwiches to salads and stews, from beautiful desserts to mouth-watering feasts, no ingredient will be left behind in your kitchen!\n\nIt also introduces a rich set of utilities: a way to **improve the very soil** your crops grow in, a brand new kind of tool to **scavenge resources** with, cute **decorations** for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!\n\nIt's time to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n \n**üìñ Getting Started**\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a [Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started) to help you learn the basics!\n\n \n**üìù FAQ**\n<details>\n<summary>Expand for FAQ</summary>\n\n**Q. How does this different from the other existing Farmer's Delight Fabric?**\n\nA. This port's main focus has been on simplicity and faithfulness to the original mod. This meant that only minor changes were made to accommodate the loader specific things.\n\nPackage names and all existing behavior has been kept the same. This means that FD addons can now easily be ported from Forge to Fabric with, ideally, no change at all as all the package names are the same.\n\n[A list of differences can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Differences.md)\n\n**Q. Will existing addons work for this?**\n\nA. While porting existing Forge addons to Fabric will be trivial, already existing Fabric addons made for the old Fabric port will NOT work and they will have to update to reflect the new package structure.\n\n[A list of supported addons and integrations can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Addons_And_Integrations.md)\n\nFeel free to ask for more compat layers, however, they will only be done if they are simple enough to be able to be done, anything more complicated and you're best to wait for a developer to support Farmer's Delight Refabricated or just accept that they might not, it's really up to them.\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Will I keep old blocks from the other FD port?**\n\nA. The mods use the same IDs so yes.\n\n**Q. Will addons for the other port be updated to use this one instead?**\n\nA. That depends on them. Updating/porting a Forge addon is trivial but this will still take a bit of time and depends on the individual modder. So please be patient and don't harrass modders.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight Refabricated is currently being updated for 1.20+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No. This mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\nPlease, do NOT ask for backports!\n</details>","published":"2024-03-27T01:59:37.106681Z","updated":"2024-04-28T21:45:16.520969Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":107474,"followers":145,"categories":["decoration","equipment","food"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["M8bp9Dk5","J5zT5dIA","UFctor0l","ETe2oDvK","FMhV8TQg","X6fzggyI","QzcIQ62s","pnmeqDCQ","6MKCnUff","Qid8WxOf","Ti8scSIz","5dZdVy3m"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/7vxePowz/26e8448993e9bda4dba92b6e7a1a13d9c4333138.png"},"version":{"id":"5dZdVy3m","project_id":"7vxePowz","author_id":"84zsGbft","featured":false,"name":"Farmer's

Fabric mod that allows for efficient connected textures","body":"## ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è **IMPORTANT** ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è: Continuity WILL NOT WORK without the **[Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium)** mod if **[Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)** is installed.\n\n# Continuity\n\nContinuity is a Fabric mod built around modern APIs to allow for the most efficient connected textures experience possible. It is designed to provide full Optifine parity for all resource packs that use the Optifine CTM format. Continuity also supports Optifine-format emissive textures for block and item models.\n\nContinuity depends on the Fabric API and is client-side only. It includes two built-in resource packs - one provides default connected textures, similar to Optifine, and the other provides a fix for glass pane culling.\n\n## Forge Version\n\nA Forge version of Continuity will not be made for the following reasons.\n\n- Forge's model API: It is vastly different from Fabric's model API (FRAPI), which is readily utilized by Continuity, and switching to it would not only require an incredible amount of effort, but also result in the mod being extremely inefficient.\n- Optifine: It has native support for Forge and provides the same features as Continuity.\n\n### Links\n\n[CurseForge

Block Entities","description":"Reduce FPS lag with block entities, as well as customize them with resource packs","body":"## Enhanced Block Entities\n\nEBE is a **100% client side** Minecraft mod for the **[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/)** mod loader which aims to increase the performance of block entity rendering, as well as offer customizability via resource packs. <br/><br/>\n**How does it work?** EBE Makes some block entities use baked block models rather than laggy entity models. <br/><br/>\n**Is it just an optimization mod?** EBE isn't *just* an optimization mod, some side effects of its optimizations are many visual improvements. <br/>\nThese may include:\n- Smooth lighting on block entities\n- Being able to remodel block entities with block models\n- Toggling features like christmas chests\n- Being able to see block entities from as far away as possible\n<br/><br/>\n\n**What about animations?** The best part about EBE is that you still get to keep animations, while gaining the performance boost of baked models! Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n**Can I use it with Sodium?** Yes you can, but for this you are **required** to install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) as well. <br/><br/> \nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: Does this mod glitch the chest animation or turn chests invisible?**\n**A:** This bug has been completely eradicated in EBE versions 0.5 and above. If the issue still persists (it shouldn't), leave an issue on GitHub or join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are still invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using a Sodium version lower than 0.5, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use a Sodium version lower than 0.5 with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With EBE\n![After](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/after.png) <br/>\nA 155% frame rate increase!\n\n## Resource Packs\nHere's an example of how you can customize chests with resource packs using EBE. <br/><br/>\n![Custom Chest GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55095883/112942134-f67fe780-912f-11eb-8b11-cf316544c22b.gif)","published":"2021-03-01T00:33:17.073472Z","updated":"2023-11-26T00:58:42.011781Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2232392,"followers":3129,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["tUbREtJR","J7Zc989q","l4eXcVcY","oiMCXKDH","HHqDCd5p","bndJ1Eq5","Zl4ETunR","ILuyoK6c","qbUAJjs9","VOB3iJkd","5FTTHyNq","88qNYjJz","Id00LoSl","s76PBY7D","fZx04xgT","6NvQpIBY","fJLBqbZ5","Xdo5ZiRc","i3v1Skck","eIFo7wvq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"i3v1Skck","project_id":"OVuFYfre","author_id":"WH9NfS5R","featured":true,"name":"EBE v0.9 for 1.20.1, 1.20","version_number":"0.9+1.20","changelog":"- Update to 1.20(.1)\n- Enhanced decorated pots","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-26T05:15:05.839603Z","downloads":1044729,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"61cfe50f69f8ef9e3640c0269ef158870f5b0410","sha512":"7e8b402fd25efd396bc7f0f25a663808ae9890accc227850c454dfcdc975657f22afceb15878e781485622434a6f6d60aff2a60264aa4425edd52ebe052a0de5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/versions/i3v1Skck/enhancedblockentities-0.9%2B1.20.jar","filename":"enhancedblockentities-0.9+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":490690,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"FLGCXPFi","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"O79BATDr","user":{"id":"WH9NfS5R","username":"FoundationGames","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43485105?v=4","bio":"download my mod please","created":"2020-10-24T21:26:35.640180Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"enhancedblockentities-0.9+1.20.jar"},"mods\\HopoBetterRuinedPortals-[1.20-1.20.2]-1.3.7.jar":{"sha512":"13f1cc8205821c135bb2439ffd291c57427e36d04e78701f240681cc30b11c4b211c2df668b69ce543a682e77998873ea158e5302edadef9e379edcaa2e8a686","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"hIpLSyga","slug":"hopo-better-ruined-portals","project_type":"mod","team":"5N7miKPV","title":"Hopo Better Ruined Portals","description":"Improve how the portals look in your world","body":"![Alt text](https://i.imgur.com/NzFFzBT.png)\n# Hopo Better Ruined Portals \"Piglin Ruins and Corruption\" [Now 1.20.5-1.20.6!] #\nüî™ Legends said that many Piglins invaded the overworld, you can find ruins caused by the war with a interesting look.\n\nü¶¥ Discover the rests: Explore, find, get and discover what piglins have been plotting in the past, examples of loots are: \"Obsidian, Armors with trims, Weapons, use your brush and investigate the gravel to get even better items like custom banners, potions, mob heads, sherds, and more.\"\n\n![Alt text](https://imgur.com/IlBNUql.png)\n![Alt text](https://imgur.com/3oSlucE.png)\n![Alt text](https://imgur.com/A5UqBQi.png)\n\n**Need an open world server 24/7 ?

multiblock alloy smelter, the¬†**Alloy Forge**. In its base configuration it serves as an easy way to increase ore yield, but everything is data-driven allowing you to add new forges and recipes as you please.¬†These data-driven features are mostly intended for mod and modpack authors, especially because new forge types can only be added through other mod-datapacks or global configuration files.¬†\n\n\n---\n\nBy default there are three forge tiers, each with different fuel capacity and speed. They're all made from different stone-like materials, you can look them up on the wiki.\n\n![Forge Tutorial](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/0ca4651a23fb13f1add7bed2820bfb2059e3e2bc.png)\n¬†\n\nAll controllers are crafted according to this pattern, with the outer ring of blocks corresponding to that controller's material. To construct a forge, simply follow the convenient guide above this piece of text using any combination of blocks that forge type supports.\n\n‚Äã\n\n<center><img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/5df27e031fe7bba7fd361683dbe662c95633d7bb.png\" /></center>\n\n![GUI](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/8c88d3b6f3d3286efb83b29bb772eba52372f7fc.png)\n\n## Development Discord:\nJoin this is if you have any issues or need help adding new content\n\n[![Discord](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/372/487/wraith.png)](http://discord.gg/Pa5wDVm8Xv)","published":"2021-08-04T18:03:42.032976Z","updated":"2024-04-16T18:29:07.248309Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":287865,"followers":279,"categories":["library","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18-pre7","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["v5mAE3vf","2qTKAxuh","PYqVtxMU","xjxCAAjP","VUJkXR0T","KNupR8qb","WAsXHXzM","7tgDdEHK","eqiifZcQ","g55A99jV","pNZY1Zxh","dgKzFFqp","Kjw1oaQc","RnZ1rNwY","64l8Gs7s","eV5QnxDI","X8QEAfXB","xHvHtN9s","UIMlHriM","jLsVVCz3","g9j3BFGw","5M7CC5jy","Iryj9UYC","kZQUifqT","f32qSRXe","DivNclkz","CDuKyCCF","D89BTI2m","EnaZWOD3","q1L7hbA8","j3GoCoCc","cm7am3F7","oBUvSX7n","X1pKXaia"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jhl28YkY/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"j3GoCoCc","project_id":"jhl28YkY","author_id":"bAS54nCE","featured":false,"name":"[1.20+] Alloy Forgery - 2.1.2","version_number":"2.1.2+1.20","changelog":"# 2.1.2\n\n- Added an icon when the recipe used in the Forge is higher than the required minimum tier","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-09T23:35:28.606303Z","downloads":61691,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"8900553bd4498af1c3e6ee3994b986e58149986bd1ad3233cddba06559cce73ae8ff47bceb125f1dab31d73be66014be67e02af86408b3872f32370574233b50","sha1":"2a5b1cdd7dacaba4012c0a3d116d726302f62dca"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jhl28YkY/versions/j3GoCoCc/alloy-forgery-2.1.2%2B1.20.jar","filename":"alloy-forgery-2.1.2+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":256944,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"af82c218cf68557b659482c8ef5e7b93c9ec8e04654b5c6bea399108c185f576731aead2ac0003016830e6726aac10cc6d87600e0f0dc8677ffefe004aaabbc0","sha1":"47b40da7010b2be5a5eb1f508a283fa5be319774"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jhl28YkY/versions/j3GoCoCc/alloy-forgery-2.1.2%2B1.20-sources.jar","filename":"alloy-forgery-2.1.2+1.20-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":164797,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"ccKDOlHs","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"JaVz7Wl9","user":{"id":"QEVDJtUF","username":"LordDeatHunter","name":"DeatHunter","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/26803198?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-01T10:54:44.631426Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Fortnite Author","ordering":0},{"team_id":"JaVz7Wl9","user":{"id":"nHj8InZT","username":"chyzman","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32403637?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-12-19T19:28:18.364866Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Mascot","ordering":0},{"team_id":"JaVz7Wl9","user":{"id":"bAS54nCE","username":"Noaaan","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4163353?v=4","bio":"Meme Metals","created":"2020-12-01T20:37:20.670950Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"JaVz7Wl9","user":{"id":"7DNYExCh","username":"Blodhgarm","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50533513?v=4","bio":"Fabric/Multiloader Mod Developer at heart with an affinity for developing mods with interesting challenges.","created":"2021-08-22T01:18:14.993460Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"alloy-forgery-2.1.2+1.20.jar"},"mods\\ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"9b7dc686bfa7937815d88c7bbc6908857cd6646b05e7a96ddbdcada328a385bd4ba056532cd1d7df9d2d7f4265fd48bd49ff683f217f6d4e817177b87f6bc457","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"uXXizFIs","slug":"ferrite-core","project_type":"mod","team":"2JhABx1f","title":"FerriteCore","description":"Memory usage optimizations","body":"This mod reduces the memory usage of Minecraft in a few different ways. A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-05-01T06:08:18.836384Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":5677998,"followers":5150,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"unerR5MN","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:39:15.937801Z","downloads":1609358,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"9b7dc686bfa7937815d88c7bbc6908857cd6646b05e7a96ddbdcada328a385bd4ba056532cd1d7df9d2d7f4265fd48bd49ff683f217f6d4e817177b87f6bc457","sha1":"8fa3b84fc5860dbc30fdf8cced02af68dffcf3fa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/unerR5MN/ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":125197,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar"},"mods\\valkyrienskies-120-2.3.0-beta.5.jar":{"sha512":"acc6a13e788768d54c9fdeb4da6f5112acbe6a11cb5f9f08f6792400e350af3c55eb18347f1f99b1c6a8ae1a1085856ebc23c51c1f1c5f60fb5b693255be20ad","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"V5ujR2yw","slug":"valkyrien-skies","project_type":"mod","team":"xtVZP6HK","title":"Valkyrien Skies","description":"Physics in Minecraft","body":"**Valkryien Skies 2 is in BETA.

All artifacts only have a few chests in which they can be found, so go out and explore! Additionally, a new underground campsite structure has been added. Mimics occasionally spawn in these campsites instead of a chests, which are dangerous enemies that attack players that get too close. Mimics always drop a random artifact when killed.\n\nEvery item added by this mod has a unique model when equipped. The full set of items and their descriptions can be found in the images tab. Sn up-to-date list of where each item can be found is available on the wiki on GitHub.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37985539/118691060-fdaaa400-b808-11eb-97c8-2f45ef277c52.png)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n#### _Some items are too powerful, is there some way I can change that?_\n\nArtifacts adds various game rules that allow you to change or completely disable the effects of all items added by the mod.\nIn versions for Forge 1.19.2 and below, most of these config options are located in the server config. Unlike the client and common config files, server config files are located in your world save's _serverconfigs_ folder. Preventing specific items from spawning in chests is currently not possible without creating a data pack, but it is possible to change how rare artifacts are in general using the artifactRarity (for items in chests) and campsite count/mimicChance (for mimics) config options.\n\n#### _How do I change the amount of slots for my artifacts?_\n\nIf you're using the Forge version, It is possible to change the number of slots of each type using the Curios server config. The '/curios' command can also be used to add/remove slots for one specific player. If you want to change the slot an artifact can be placed in, you will need to create a data pack and change the item tags that determine the artifact's slot types.\nMore information on how to do all of these things can be found on the [Curios wiki](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users).\n\nIf you're using the Fabric version, modifying the number of slots players have requires creating a data pack.

The new statistics screen features an easier to navigate and read UI layout, as well as a few filters and a search field that will help you find the statictics you need a lot easier, especially when there are dozens, if not hundreds of entries to keep track of.\n\n### Dependencies (v3.9.7+)\nNote that \"client\" refers to installing mods to the game launched through a Minecraft launcher, whereas \"server\" refers to installing mods to a server you join through the \"multiplayer\" menu.\n\n| Requirements | Client | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Better Statistics Screen](#) | Optional | Optional |\n| [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/P7dR8mSH) | Required as of `1.20.5` | Required as of `1.20.5` |\n| [TCDCommons API](https://modrinth.com/mod/Eldc1g37) | Optional | Optional |\n| [Roughly Enough Items (REI)](https://modrinth.com/mod/nfn13YXA) | Optional | Not needed |\n| [Mod menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/mOgUt4GM) | Optional | Not needed |\n\n## Features\nThis mod aims to improve on the existing features, as well as add additional features that may futher be helpful in tracking and managing one's statistics.  \n  \nNote that any optional features that this mod adds to the game, such as the \"/statistics\" command and the \"Stat announcement system\", may be disabled in the config or though the in-game mod settings menu.\n\n### The `/statistics` command\n**Alt command:** `/stats`  \nThis is an optional feature that adds a command that allows people (with sufficient permission levels, such as OP) to manage and view player statistics through commands. This feature may also be useful for writing datapacks that may wanna read as well as manage player statistics.  \n\n*Note: Can be disabled in the config.*\n\n**The command syntax is the following:**\n- `/statistics clear <targets>`\n- `/statistics edit <targets> <stat_type> <stat> (set|increase) <value>`\n- [ex. general stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:custom minecraft:jump set 123`\n- [ex. item stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:used minecraft:wooden_shovel set 123`\n- [ex. mob stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:killed minecraft:zombie set 123`\n\n### The \"Stat announcement system\"\nThis is an optional server-sided feature that broadcasts special messages when players do certain things or achieve certain stats or \"milestones\". As of `v3.9.7`, the SAS announces when players achieve certain stats for the first time, such as for example \"Mining their first diamond\", or \"Crafting their first item of a specific type\", and so on..  \n  \n*Note: Can be disabled in the config.*  \n  \n![The SAS in action](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/assets/66475965/3467ecae-5393-4fa9-9bf3-5146cc07f7b7)\n\n### The \"General\" statistics tab\nThis tab does not add nor show anything special regarding general statistics other than the redesigned UI layout. The filters menu features a way for you to hide all general statistics that are currently set to '0', as well as a search bar that will help you look for a specific statistic.  \n  \n![General statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/f612dcb73d9e4ffc4ca0494559a31221396c2435.png)\n\n### The \"Items\" statistics tab\nThe items tab displays items in a visual grid of items, similar to how an inventory screen does it. The items are categorized in item groups, just like they would be in the creative inventory menu. All items you interacted with are shown in this tab. This will hopefully help you find the items you are looking for easier. The search field in the filters menu can be used to look for specific items. To see a statistic for an item, place your cursor over the said item, or use \"Tab\" to navigate to it using your keyboard, and a tooltip text will display the statistics. The \"Show item names\" checkbox defines whether or not the tooltip will also show the item name.  \n  \n![Item statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/5ef05e79400d4e0d386f899dc1849f72731c0372.png)\n\n### The \"Mobs\" statistics tab\nSimilar to the \"Items\" tab, the \"Mobs\" tab will also show mobs in a grid. The mobs are visually rendered on the GUI screen, so it is easier for you to find the mob you are looking for, and because it looks nicer. Just like with the items tab, to see the statistics for a given mob, place your cursor over the said mob, or use \"Tab\" to navigate to it using your keyboard. A tooltip text will show you the statistics.  \n  \n*Note that due to technical limitations in my programming, some mobs may fail to render properly, and some mobs may even appear as \"plain text\" instead of their 3D model due to errors in my rendering method.*  \n  \n![Mob statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fd6c360face8ba7fcf05224a08044614c7eb9496.png)\n\n### The \"Food & drinks\" statistics tab (formerly \"A balanced diet\")\nThis tab aims to help you achieve the \"A balanced died\" advancement. It does that by displaying all food items in grouped grids, similarly to how the \"Items\" tab does it. This tab will show you all food items, even the ones you haven't interacted with, and will also highlight the foods you already ate before, helping you identify which foods you need to eat next to earn the advancement.  \n  \n*Note that this tab may not precisely tell you exactly which foods you do and do not need, as that kind of criteria is controlled \"server-side\", and may be modified by other mods and data-packs. As such, all foods are shown instead.*  \n\n![Food & drinks statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/9e3478d0573276349e9842337de3cf598dcf75db.png)\n\n### The \"Hostile creatures\" statistics tab (formerly \"Monsters Hunted\")\nThis tab aims to help you achieve the \"Monsters hunted\" advancement. It shows you a grid of mobs similarly to the \"Mobs\" tab, except the mobs shown on this tab are hostile creatures you have either killed or are yet to kill. Similarly to the \"Food & drinks\" tab, any mobs you have killed will be highlighted in this tab, helping you easily see which mobs you need to kill next in order to earn the advancement.  \n  \n*Note that just like with \"Food & drinks\", the criteria for getting the advancement is controlled server-side, and may be modified by other mods and data-packs. As such, all hostile creatures are always shown.*  \n\n![Hostile creatures statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fe98cfce86319282774228f4f4c81748eaa00139.png)\n\n### In-game config menu\nA menu that lets you configure the mod in-game. Nothing more or less.  \n\n![In-game config menu](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/7413856bcf4e799b7e265bcf732f17cbb1e2e7c2.png)\n\n### MCBS files\nThis is an additional feature that aims to let people save a \"snapshot\" of their current statistics, into a file, which can then be opened later or shared with other players.  \n  \n*Note that opening an MCBS file does not \"override\" you current stats, as it only shows you what your stats looked like at the time you saved the MCBS file.*\n\n![Saving a file](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/315ca6da7dcb943b3435c6a11917393786ae4367.png)\n![Opening a file](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/5f1855efceb8870339456bb1d3e8235d795f3cfe.png)\n\n### The statistics hud\nThis is another additional feature that allows you to \"pin\" any stat to the \"in-game-hud\", where you can then look at any statistic of your choosing as you play the game. To pin a stat, simply right-click it with your mouse (hold down shift as well if you have REI installed).  \n\n*Note that due to technical limitations, pinned statistics update occasionally by default, and will not update \"live\" unless this mod is installed on the server-side as well and the \"live stat updates\" is enabled on the client-side.*  \n\n![Pinning stats](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/3c7e15962f4c8a2268bc5da9a2e7d97ae7850fb6.png)\n![Configuring pinned stats](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/681f25b72304d0fdde71ab3104d51fab506c3c34.png)\n![What pinned stats look like during gameplay](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fd7f29e99ed6b73981b2e2cbcdb4eddb93a2bbcb.png)\n\n## Some QnA\n- What about Minecraft Forge?\n    - I have no plans on making future ports to Forge or any other mod loaders. See [GitHub Issue #100](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/issues/100) for more info. However, not all hope is lost!¬†[Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/u58R1TMW) is a mod that lets people run Fabric mods on Forge! Please check it out. Also keep in mind the mod is in beta (as of me writing this), so please don't be harsh towards the mod's developers while expecting the mod to work 100% of the time.\n- Port to older Minecraft versions?\n    - Nope. Same reason as the 'Minecraft Forge' one.\n- I can't pin stats to the hud. I right-click them, but REI shows up instead. How do I pin stats?\n    - Hold down the left shift button while right clicking a stat. That is, if you have REI installed.\n\n## Credits\nThank you to everyone who contributed to the project and helped translate the mod to other languages! And a special thank **you**, the person reading this, for choosing to use this mod! (Well, thank you even if you're just checking out the mod and not actually using it. That also means a lot!)\n\n### The showcase YouTube video I recorded\nI decided to test the mod as well as take screenshots and video footage of the mod in my survival world from the [Better Minecraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-fabric) mod pack, so as to show how this mod works and that it works with modded features as well. The screenshots and the video footage also feature the [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders) being used alongside [Iris](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders), as well as the [BYG](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oh-the-biomes-youll-go) mod.\n\n### The screenshots I took\nResource packs and shader packs used at the time of screenshotting.\n- [Complementary shaders](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/)\n- [3D Default](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/5aPp18Lx)\n- [3D crops Revamped](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/PgpTtNoI)\n- [Default Dark Mode](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/6SLU7tS5)\n\nSorry if I missed any.

This mod significantly increases these caps to allow those mods to work as they were intended.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Affected Attributes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Max Health</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Follow Range</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Knockback Resistance</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Movement Speed</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Attack Damage</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Attack Speed</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Armor&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Armor Toughness</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:left\">Luck</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

Adds an option to choose the crafting result if more than one is available.","body":"Polymorph is a mod that solves recipe conflicts by letting players choose between all potential\noutputs shared by the same ingredients.\n\nWith a sufficiently large amount of mods, recipe conflicts are a common occurrence and the\nresponsibility for resolving these usually falls on the user or modpack developer, using datapacks\nor other tools to ensure that each recipe is unique.\n\nPolymorph offers an alternative solution, allowing all possible crafting and smelting recipes to\nco-exist regardless of conflicts.\n\n## Features\n\n### Crafting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/TkWswkG/polymorph.gif)\n\nWhen a group of ingredients matches more than one recipe, a button will appear above the output\nslot. Pushing this button will show a list of all possible results and selecting one will change the\ncrafting output to match. Polymorph will also remember the last selection as long as the ingredients\ndon't change, so repeated crafting actions are possible on the same selection.\n\n### Smelting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/QX9MNYM/polymorph-furnacedemo.gif)\n\nWhen a valid input matches more than one output, a button will appear above the output slot. Pushing\nthis button will show a list of all possible results with the currently selected result highlighted\nin green. Selecting one of the listed results will change the smelting output to match. This\nselection will be saved to the block itself and persist across world loading and unloading.\n\n### Smithing\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GTCgL3S/smithingconflicts.png)\n\nExactly like the crafting screen, a button will appear above the output slot when a valid input matches more than one\noutput. Upon selection, the output will change to match.\n\n### Commands\n\nTo assist identifying potential conflicts, there's a command `/polymorph conflicts` that will try to identify recipes\nthat conflict with each other and outputs a list of them to your logs folder. Currently, the command will scan crafting,\nsmelting, blasting, smoking, and smithing recipes.\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n","published":"2023-02-03T20:08:37.444573Z","updated":"2024-06-03T00:45:59.863661Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":938877,"followers":405,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["diy4s2XO","66Bkdq05","68l9BR3j","bT9w3gh5","hR8YtS8a","gxwQtnsA","vAv92Cl4","vuRsKlbz","cnPRpn78","tLFw14o5","haoNzeyv","750iJ3hO","rect6WEh","aYxyXMzJ","ChHxCoAb","STYYlkp8","wN8G3kAN","skUakdXR","uAleZkbS","SNlci35k","GKZ6KVfs","6Nyu412V","VQtXcHcR","bIDSNOm5","UlRasi89","l15iQHMn","AWwJD7yS","7L5hC81R","zncS6GGa","pJZr4yc3","8zhVFKEL","Sj0OPjRM","2BAp032A","FBfg7una","E4b6m0sQ","GcFD377O","km82tZAr","gXWxJGsW","Y8yR5ZhZ","qA4syOxx","akZJjqpV","iaqnjwBU","6tFcWl5d","Mq4la1Hv","W3ii0PIQ","N1NUMRCn","89IAarqG","ByjYK8ay","EYWxtHOI","V6TZ8mE6","OQP0nLJU","R9HsHDwY","GTEspIbt","wZ1N91Ci","yPIvYQkJ","QoURX3fY","3RJxqsNz","p4JIL4TF","3XAwKo9y","HpXWxhc2","WNLgny3d","9XFy7cdd"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/ed244c5829bde539763c7fffb55cb3194a349d66.png"},"version":{"id":"EYWxtHOI","project_id":"tagwiZkJ","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"polymorph-fabric-0.49.5+1.20.1","version_number":"0.49.5+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)","published":"2021-01-04T05:14:07.259717Z","updated":"2022-06-08T01:13:18.555078Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":3171395,"followers":3587,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["8tFjDrHf","aBDhdWUD","C6e265zK","4SHylIO9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hvFnDODi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4SHylIO9","project_id":"hvFnDODi","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.1.3","version_number":"0.1.3","changelog":"* Update to Minecraft 1.19\n* Mojang now (by default) does not build datafixer rules on servers.

There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-13T21:48:54.507121Z","updated":"2024-05-17T18:01:40.290916Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":1046517,"followers":1760,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["Q9qUUqA7","Wd3Co0mZ","81tshMIZ","Xf5mFGCS","jUK1mCz3","1latp88m","pNFzTzQd","mLdNNka6","K3S6BASh","aYOzrVFZ","Y4i2gvLB","D0hKeWDQ","JT2esX5R","8N8lLvTW","34PhE3zd","2w1uZoRC","PNByHzei","WZvndtxX","UJtMNPNx","Rq2BBA8A","hYoo0DKV","CDrDiFNK","qFd4s3fV","FOe2l0tx","IWVbiEbl","1hOeraaL","4KrRTVvQ","WgDuoe1K","xm11wemG","FgvUosFH","zA1qYB0L","6DoFR4md","owDSctxm","rWmFwtGy"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/34c751cc804839ed3c1d9f21dfd53d98368fedfc.png"},"version":{"id":"rWmFwtGy","project_id":"8oi3bsk5","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v2.5.1 ~ 1.20.x","version_number":"2.5.1","changelog":"# Terralith 2.5.1\n- Fixed issue where foliage in Underground Jungle could generate inside and replace water\n- The new alternative redstone component recipes now reference stones correctly\n- Added support for [Biome Tag Villagers](https://modrinth.com/mod/biome-tag-villagers) when using the experimental villager rework flag","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-17T18:01:41.792773Z","downloads":58954,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e95f3b0fe7b2f3f2475da8009f4491e48edc4b60","sha512":"459fec3da3474011195dff101c8303a5d9d8f1e431d99b4398cc087d0c4045fd42b49b16720ca4ea17e18180e9bc9d19a327361a58fe0ebae7a3f7f6db34b5d1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/versions/rWmFwtGy/Terralith_1.20_v2.5.1.jar","filename":"Terralith_1.20_v2.5.1.jar","primary":true,"size":3197597,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"]},"members":[],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Terralith_1.20_v2.5.1.jar"},"mods\\Botania-1.20.1-444-FABRIC.jar":{"sha512":"bc6685b3defb4e0a90824b07e4476cef2c8f6f56b831ffeee218967974c75dd089908c2a17d1a16747ffa0876fdf7e424fad663c93eca3a3fb51099c3785847c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"pfjLUfGv","slug":"botania","project_type":"mod","team":"ZHXzsq7V","title":"Botania","description":"An innovative natural magic themed tech mod","body":"[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm0.png)](https://violetmoon.org)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm1.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm2.png)](https://twitter.com/vazkiimods)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm3.png)](https://discord.gg/vm)\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/hero/botania.png)\n\n---\n\n# About\n\nWarning: Botania **Requires [Patchouli](https://modrinth.com/mod/patchouli) and [Curios (Forge)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios) or [Trinkets (Fabric/Quilt)](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets)!**  \n\n**Botania** is a tech mod themed around natural magic. Gameplay is centered around creating magical flowers and devices using Mana, the power of the earth. Botania is fully playable as a standalone mod (and is designed as such), but it functions just well in conjunction with other mods.\n\nThe mod focuses on automation, but without elements that make it feel grindy-- systems can be thought out and designed, rather than built blindly from blueprints in JEI or a wiki.\n\n**Botania's design philosophy**\n\n* No pipes, wires, etc-- they're boring and overdone;\n* No GUIs-- interact with everything in-world;\n* No numbers-- players shouldn't try to minmax everything;\n* Keep all resources as renewable as possible;\n* Provide pleasing visuals, despite using only two different particle effects.\n\n**Botania's goals**\n\n* Break the mold of mods being means to ends-- be engaging in gameplay as well as in rewards;\n* Deliver fun and balanced

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nThere's also an option to enter an idle state while the window is active but hasn't received any input in a certain amount of time.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops \nrendering the world while it's being obscured by opaque screens or the resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only slow the client render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all

It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">üì• Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">‚úÖ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# üêõ How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ‚öôÔ∏è Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.","published":"2021-01-03T00:53:34.185936Z","updated":"2024-04-29T16:00:45.150007Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":10906082,"followers":13376,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["yaoBL9D9","YAGZ1cCS","1b0GhKHj","80jYkEVr","xuWxRZPd","3JJvf9Kn","6YGRDUVT","Fz37KqRh","5JyduDNN","74Y5Z8fo","Yp8wLY1P","F79MzDJD","rAfhHfow","mnEhtGuH","Nr39FOaS","ObtU68vj","oYfJQ6lR","idtcaIVT","b4hTi3mo","vgceLbdH","hiO9bwqc","OkwCNtFH","6SSPmLc9","4OZL6q9h","bbP1qBMr","lhZYeXLf","zPwAvKCF","InGKdfel","pmgeU5yX","rUXIwGKA","xNJ0Mpbx","umKbm1Rp","Wzzjm5lQ","mhZtY2lR","4GyXKCLd","hLV8Q8uu","IZskON6d"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"mhZtY2lR","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"TEZXhE2U","featured":true,"name":"Sodium 0.5.8","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.5.8","changelog":"- Fixed compatibility with Fabric API 0.95.3+ when using High Contrast or Programmer Art resource packs.\n- Improved support for keyboard accessibility features in parts of the video settings screen.

This mod is the base of those parts, other APIs in my catalog build upon this base (like Amethyst Core for magic mods)_\n\n### Coding Utils\n\nFzzy core contains several utilities that make coding mods just a bit easier! These utilities include:\n\n* A base Enchantment Class that can be easily integrated with a configuration system to disable/enable individual enchantments.\n* A wrapper for Text that avoids headaches involved with multi-version mods and having to constantly battle merge conflicts on Text changes\n* A persistent effect system that allows for creation of delayed, repeating (or non-repeating) events that aren't tied to a specific objects tick or other messy implementation.\n* A particle creation system that allows for placing client-side particles at a certain spot in a players POV. This allows for items with particles dripping off them, a torch that emits smoke, etc.\n\n \n### Synced Configuration System\n\nCreate an easy-to-manage config system that allows for version control over time, and automatically syncs server configs to joining clients!\n\n* Takes advantage of some of Kotlin's unique functionality for a simple and clean looking implementation\n* Helper methods for automatic updating of config files to new versions, capturing the information from the old version before replacing it with the update.\n* Simple implementation of auto-syncing functions.\n\n \n### Custom Flavor Items\n\nAdd basic or tool items with flavortext!\n\n* Default implementation is simply some new lines in the lang file\n* Optional methods for more complex text\n* Also adds description text, for explaining what flavortext means, or for describing item functionality\n\n \n### Mana Items\n\nAdds a simple framework for creating items that use mana instead of being damaged in the typical way.\n\n \n### Modifier Framework\n\nThe Modifier Framework is a flexible and extensible system designed as a parallel to the vanilla Enchanting system. Modifiers aim to solve two of the biggest problems I found with Enchanting: They are easily removable, and they do not internalize their functionality (besides a couple damage methods). Enchantments are also more boring than they could be, displaying their tier with a simple number. Modifiers aim to fix all of those issues!\n\n* Modifiers are designed to be permanent, acting more like affixes. Grindstones can't remove them, for example.\n* Modifiers are designed to internalize their functionality, and can be called as one unit rather than piecemeal.\n* Modifiers act via a \"family tree\" that allow for flavorful tiers. Think of a sword going from \"Rusty\" to \"Shiny\" to \"Gleaming\" etc.\n\n \n\nThe library comes with builtin helper method for displaying modifiers\nAn example tooltip demonstrating modifiers in gold text \n\nSee the wiki link above for more details on these features. Once implemented, a Modifier system can do just about anything. Amethyst Core, for example, has a built-in AugmentModifier that does things from affecting mana cost and cooldown, to changing spell damage or range, to triggering advanced effects like afflicting every mob in a 12 block radius around the caster with Wither upon any successful spell cast.\n\n \n\nModifers can be as simple as a container for passing vanilla AttributeModifiers, or much more complex than the AugmentModifier described above. They could even be used purely for flavor if desired!\n\n \n### Nbt Util\n\nFzzy Core includes a simple util for performing some useful actions on NBT\n\n* read and write BlockPos with a single helper method, instead of manually saving X, Y, Z coords or doing Long conversion\n* Several NbtList utilities for reading from, adding to, and removing from NbtLists\n* An ItemStackId system for attaching a unique identifier to certain itemstacks. This allows, for example, an ItemStack keyed to a specific block entity... or much more!\n* A helper method for transferring non-enchantment NBT from one stack to another.\n\n \n### Raycaster Util\n\nA simple set of helper methods for locating objects\n\n* Server-sided raycasting for detection of game objects without needing to do fancy networking\n* Helper methods for entities, blocks, and locating things in areas around a point (like a player)\n* Ability to check for entities with arbitrarily rotated cuboids. Minecraft's default detection systems all use boxes aligned to the XYZ grid. This is useful for something like checking what enemies a spell hits, even if the player is looking diagonally and up a hill.\n\n \n### Event Registry\n\nRegistry for adding and tracking basic ticking objects not related to specific objects like entities.\n\n* Useful for creating periodic clocks that only fire every X ticks, allowing for creation of tick methods that don't fire every single tick. In fact, the registry comes with a 1 second, 1.5 second, and 2 second interval clock built in.\n* Adds a TickUppable interface and Ticker class for registration of objects to the registry.\n\n \n### Item Model Registry\n\nWant to make a custom trident but can't figure out how in heck to make the in-hand Trident appear like MC's does? This registry is for you!\n\n* Register custom item models for specific render modes (in hand, on ground, etc)\n* Integrates with the standard Fabric BuiltinItemRendererRegistry.DynamicItemRenderer\n\n \n### EffectQueue\n\nHate how adding passive status effects sometimes results in statuses \"fighting\" in the GUI, with statuses rapidly swapping back and forth?\n\n* This simple utility unifies the additions of all status effects passed into it into a predictable order\n* Uses all the standard status effect information you expect with addStatusEffect\n\n \n### Trinket Utils\n\nFzzy Core integrates optionally with Trinkets, adding some utility functions that can be used with them\n\n* getTrinketStacks provides a list of all Tirnkets equipped to the passed living entity\n* the AugmentTasks interface allows for creation of Trinkets that interact with special enchantments call Augments. These augments allow for trinkets with customizable passive and active abilities.","published":"2023-02-03T15:16:31.426932Z","updated":"2024-04-28T18:37:32.363372Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":222113,"followers":28,"categories":["game-mechanics","library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["ndIps2V5","b1r9hqit","TyedjopD","jlbK22fV","nXjBTlU8","kA5GUcQN","GUEK1Dqr","o5HyRhRQ","fCsc7KDn","KkoGimcF","xiosgEv7","yqlqLvu8","KmK6eyb1","srGr0kEF","fmbpBARS","SsxOstvS","R0Z86IqQ","w27F4mQN","Pa1sgpF0","cFoQ21i8","VhXzJU5B","sTtZBmX2","KzdbDTuK","gDkoqjEK","98ulVIFp","Okk8QtaS","eKWH3jGK","s2zkvlJ6","eKJOisy1","8VDWk1sx","FAARzWkk","LDtlokNZ","yFyhdjxb","7aws6Qws","TNQO1KHX","iT0usf7m","lUj1i8VZ","tb0jIpzn","G6CaE33O"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LJ5wlCDr/88d1d3e749b81e988eb3a12b60b259cf516b0bec.png"},"version":{"id":"G6CaE33O","project_id":"LJ5wlCDr","author_id":"ANKRvkxl","featured":false,"name":"fzzy_core-0.5.1+1.20.1","version_number":"0.5.1+1.20.1","changelog":"### Additions\n* None\n\n### Changes\n* None\n\n### Fixes\n* Fixed `ModifierHelperType` registry not loading before registry freeze in certain circumstances.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-28T18:37:33.005881Z","downloads":6032,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a5478333e93a7af3267890a775276cd109b3453a31dfa6fededae50af5505e283e207da9ba3e39e10a4f7f55ebda97b069743092e1c9576287eae002397e0f46","sha1":"72b76630165621f8c268af7356a3c4f9c25dbc20"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LJ5wlCDr/versions/G6CaE33O/fzzy_core-0.5.1%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"fzzy_core-0.5.1+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":530986,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"F7zc3ZJZ","user":{"id":"ANKRvkxl","username":"fzzyhmstrs","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72876796?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-13T21:42:13.876320Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fzzy_core-0.5.1+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\cc-tweaked-1.20.1-fabric-1.110.3.jar":{"sha512":"99e880e3833901d445ca7f9f0908a00838879bcaddf6e3a0d9a3bf1c1179c8c82ccdfa55bc6fd1728f4fafda73ce0d73513adf84ed9e586a6d5f192d1f3b58b6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"gu7yAYhd","slug":"cc-tweaked","project_type":"mod","team":"xob83kJz","title":"CC: Tweaked","description":"ComputerCraft fork adding programmable computers, turtles and more to Minecraft.","body":"<!--\nSPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2022 The CC: Tweaked Developers\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0\n-->\n\n# ![CC: Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/logo.png)\nCC: Tweaked is a mod for Minecraft which adds programmable computers, turtles and more to the game.

They can move about the world, placing and breaking blocks, swinging a sword to protect you from zombies,\nor whatever else you program them to!\n\n![A turtle tunneling in Minecraft.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/turtle.png)\n\nNot all problems can be solved with a pickaxe though, and so CC: Tweaked also provides a bunch of additional peripherals\nfor your computers. You can play a tune with speakers, display text or images on a monitor, connect all your\ncomputers together with modems, and much more.\n\nComputers can now also interact with inventories such as chests, allowing you to build complex inventory and item\nmanagement systems.\n\n![A chest's contents being read by a computer and displayed on a monitor.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/peripherals.png)\n\n## Getting Started\nWhile ComputerCraft is lovely for both experienced programmers and for people who have never coded before, it can be a\nlittle daunting getting started. Thankfully, there's several fantastic tutorials out there:\n\n - [Direwolf20's ComputerCraft tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUHUhfCY5A \"ComputerCraft Tutorial Episode 1 - HELP! and Hello World\")\n - [Sethbling's ComputerCraft series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSsx4VSe-Uk \"Programming Tutorial with Minecraft Turtles -- Ep. 1: Intro to Turtles and If-Then-Else_End\")\n - [Lyqyd's Computer Basics 1](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/15033-computer-basics-i/ \"Computer Basics I\")\n\nOnce you're a little more familiar with the mod, the [wiki](https://tweaked.cc/) provides more detailed documentation on the\nvarious APIs and peripherals provided by the mod.\n\nIf you get stuck, do [ask a question on GitHub][GitHub Discussions] or pop in to the ComputerCraft's [IRC channel][IRC].\n\n## Get Involved\nCC: Tweaked lives on [GitHub].

It has a dedicated [online editor](https://puffish.net/skillsmod/editor/) to help building skills layout. There is also an API which allows extending the functionality and managing skills.\n\n## Latest changes (Important)\n\nIn the recent update the mod was split, the core part is [Pufferfish's Skills](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/puffish-skills). Attributes are a separate mod [Pufferfish's Attributes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/puffish-attributes). The default skill trees were also removed, but can still be downloaded as a data pack [Default Skill Trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/default-skill-trees).\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe easiest way is to download [Default Skill Trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/default-skill-trees) data pack. You can modify it according to your needs. Most skills in that trees increase player attributes. In the game there isn't many of them and that's why there is a [Pufferfish's Attributes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/puffish-skills) mod which used to be a part of the mod.\n\n## Commands\n\n`/puffish_skills points add <player> <category> <count>` - Adds points.\n\n`/puffish_skills points set <player> <category> <count>` - Sets points.\n\n`/puffish_skills experience add <player> <category> <amount>` - Adds experience.\n\n`/puffish_skills experience set <player> <category> <amount>` - Sets experience.\n\n`/puffish_skills skills unlock <player> <category> <skill>` - Unlocks skill.\n\n`/puffish_skills skills reset <player> <category>` - Locks all skills, points are refunded.\n\n`/puffish_skills category lock <player> <category>` - Locks category.\n\n`/puffish_skills category unlock <player> <category>` - Unlocks category.\n\n`/puffish_skills category erase <player> <category>` - Resets points, experience, skills.\n\n## Default keybindings\n\n`k` - Opens skills screen.\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfiguration is JSON driven. It is possible to reload in without restarting game using `/reload` command.\n\nTo easily edit skills you can use [online editor](https://puffish.net/skillsmod/editor/).\n\nYou can read more about configuration in the [documentation](https://puffish.net/skillsmod/docs/).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric. What's more it is cross-compatible, so the client can use different loader than the server.\n\nThis mod should not conflict with other mods. Please report an issue if you find an incompatibility.\n\n## Versions\n\nVersions that are maintained and will receive future updates: 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.19.4, 1.20, 1.20.2 1.20.4.\n\n## Modpacks\n\nYou can use this mod in your modpack as long as you do not redistribute this mod.\n\n## Community-made tutorials\n\n<details>\n\t<summary>Videos</summary>\n\t<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Yzd0ZoKjng\"></iframe>\n\t<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tf-ACXH8wrU\"></iframe>\n</details>","published":"2023-03-02T17:29:10.825438Z","updated":"2024-05-21T11:09:59.513037Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":226371,"followers":353,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":["management"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["XrSWHv6k","iJl5I6Iv","QVJckfEf","VgYs0lYq","wD58hVEg","5MmH5UYU","bUstC8BU","gc3tr52W","pSX5apXa","exI1NlCI","dypHT1hp","z0rzqQO8","t3LvDTZF","sUSwUI6x","rqCO5wtJ","JUUhR9By","Quts69BT","imA5YGUG","EION0hTb","dec1CC3s","sBngmOHc","t12CwJMO","PgCc0Mj2","YYi3XM29","1YH2kFOX","MNrO1h7i","dps8iv1W","FtnflkYs","PjYe5HFb","dy9Z93c0","Weetapo3","vZjFW1ys","HsyvZ2ug","SOWc1QQw","MqcrNL0Z","WQd7CkBH","WGazi4Db","hp06DmMs","o8OvlKDP","sa9qS8tr","4n2mygBI","bAulJc02","T9lMguY1","rbqgXJkq","gupYwLXB","Ozn4WmEJ","tS0D1tgP","qD9XyQgj","O9N8GGdc","HaunBNqr","ucju3XGR","dLo3OMXK","7VVmbMiX","TWwIup5M","1Mg1toxs","VwEQfSf8","CEwZlWaH","ZpUBQydw","kx400ESr","mh48cvZA","tJFzpCiA","FZv94RR4","nE1JgApP","2EvkKMq4","MIb7Tq6c","mfA2XKJZ","ZfE4m8PC","GSNgjODX","5euWpzjq","YduGH9Sa","Ol0H9TRl","m9NAuWqw","pOOpfis7","5QzouTgi","KInH6iCV","2amZIV8M","IwAC94FZ","G4FPPLKR","2nfVonjE","mPFu3NLi","MfwmmQtN","EOuPAxbn","6Ifx6okD","PYy9afVf","qaA3a5lz","VzxkQnCd","m9flv6aD","2PfOUsXJ","djYyI9Le","MoISFSPJ","IRTU4TvB","AkJwi3eW","Fx5MbhxI","ubivVQm3","bGPAx4OK","VkznwDUF","FvbLhMtM","S4Ut6J8I","RpZcmCa1","g6ILDIk5","PtSyvZac","LnPUe8jC","WXiI01bx","OXYga1CZ","c7D4XV9V","DgiWcCju","BLUweVgj","RmGPDksN","YrjGq8Sk","oe2aHLrc","SE3d14cx","f7O8dT0T","g3xrYsxM","NoSXoO4M","g5FUuHKJ","sJvEKO49","P1wvw0rO","bBkRA7dL","LxIwHNv5"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hqQqvaa4/03ee8cc78c05ab021cfc96664741dd66fc69e515.png"},"version":{"id":"f7O8dT0T","project_id":"hqQqvaa4","author_id":"3fJOgX88","featured":false,"name":"Pufferfish's Skills 0.12.2","version_number":"0.12.2","changelog":"- Added scoreboard and tag operations.\n- Added option to set number of required skills.\n- Popup now shows when there is an error in a data pack.\n- Fixed switch operation.\n- Added missing operation in kill entity experience source.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-21T11:08:22.745932Z","downloads":3894,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d1065b7c4eb89d18762d735f92442d6f8a991915","sha512":"3bef3cffa5549e80c5d32f3fb0e364557b01bc8d314a34c5d3abc31e1ec529e02d8cfef87d835beda259a5e5ce558b228b14f243373e9d700130068655cd36a6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hqQqvaa4/versions/f7O8dT0T/puffish_skills-0.12.2-1.20-fabric.jar","filename":"puffish_skills-0.12.2-1.20-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":451691,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hhdIvQJ6","user":{"id":"3fJOgX88","username":"Pufferfish","name":"pufferfish","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82769502?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-28T22:28:22.642802Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"puffish_skills-0.12.2-1.20-fabric.jar"},"mods\\edf-remastered-4.3.jar":{"sha512":"a08f40e37344c5608ac31e67758107ee42a637140f94d0feb8d1920c19b4ab1eebc40d5bcc3e538f8404401029efdc6986ced158feb4e72bb48a561f7f376fa5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"HQsBdHGd","slug":"edf-remastered","project_type":"mod","team":"jjgwjnpw","title":"Ender Dragon Fight Remastered","description":"An up in difficulty for Minecraft's final boss.\nWith more health and more attacks, the fight finally feels like the final confrontation.","body":"**Hey there!

The inventory can be filled by hand or blocks that output their items such as hoppers or dispensers.

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates:

mod to optimize the Minecraft networking stack","body":"## Warning\n\n**Krypton is a work-in-progress.** I do not provide any guarantees about its stability, compatibility with other mods, or support for every possible setup out there.

[Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## What's Krypton?\n\nKrypton (from Ancient Greek _kryptos_, \"the hidden one\") is a Fabric mod that attempts to optimize the Minecraft networking stack. It derives from work\ndone in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) and [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)\nprojects.\n\nKrypton contains several optimizations, including:\n\n* **Highly optimized Netty handlers** derived from the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com) proxy, which I am the developer of. These handlers have seen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.\n* **Flush consolidation** to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.\n* **Micro-optimizations** to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.\n\n[Please join my Discord](https://discord.gg/RUGArxEQ8J) to discuss the mod or get support.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nKrypton should work anywhere where a Minecraft can run &mdash; naturally, however, it is tuned for Linux.\n\nI try to ensure that Krypton will work with the Fabric API, Lithium, and Sodium.

It aims to provide both metadata and peripherals for vanilla Minecraft and mainstream mods.","body":"# Plethora-Fabric\n\nPlethora is a ComputerCraft/CC:Tweaked peripheral provider for Minecraft 1.20.1. Plethora-Fabric is a port of \n[Plethora](https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/plethora) for Fabric 1.20.1. It aims to provide both metadata and\nperipherals for vanilla Minecraft and (*TODO*) mainstream mods.\n\nPlethora also adds a series of \"modules\" to the game. These modules can be used by the player with varying success.\nThey really come in to their element when put in a manipulator, providing a series of methods which allow\ninteracting with your environment. This includes:\n- Introspection: investigating the current player's inventory (and ender chest)\n- Scanner: scans blocks in an area, gathering metadata about them.\n- Sensor: scans entities in an area. Like the scanner this allows getting metadata.\n- Frickin' laser beam. It fires lasers.\n- Kinetic augment: allows remote access to your muscles, making them even stronger than before.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to embed a computer in your skull then today is your lucky day. Plethora provides a neural\ninterface which can be attached to your head, or some unsuspecting animal or monster. Right-clicking the entity with a\nneural controller allows you to interact with it. You can insert modules (which will be wrapped as peripherals) and\nmanipulate them with the built-in computer. Building a cyborg army has never been so easy.\n\nYou can also add a kinetic augment to the neural interface. This allows controlling the host entity in various ways.\n\n## Port status\nThe port to Fabric is still ongoing. SwitchCraft's needs were prioritised in the port, but we eventually aim to support\nas much of the original mod as possible. For a detailed list of differences to the original mod, and information on how\nto migrate your code, see the changes list at [docs.sc3.io](https://docs.sc3.io/features/plethora.html).\n\n## Requirements\n- Minecraft 1.20.1\n- [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer)\n- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n- [CC: Tweaked](https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-tweaked)\n- [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets)\n\n## Documentation\nThere is pretty comprehensive documentation on [the Plethora website](https://squiddev-cc.github.io/plethora/). This\ncontains tutorials, explanations of several fundamental concepts and thoroughly explained examples. For a detailed list \nof differences to the 1.12.2 mod, and information on how to migrate your code, see the changes list at \n[docs.sc3.io](https://docs.sc3.io/features/plethora.html).\n\n## Images\n![](https://squiddev-cc.github.io/plethora/images/squids-laser.png)\n\n> You know, I have one simple request.

Even after the enchanting screen is closed! To put this new capability to good use, enchanting tables will <strong>Render Their Contents</strong> in the world. There are two different rendering modes to choose from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Rerolling Enchantments</strong> has become extremely easy. The enchanting screen now has a dedicated button to do just that at a small cost of some lapis lazuli and a few experience points (not full enchantment levels to not ruin your level progress for enchanting as much). Costs are fully configurable and can even be set to completely free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Enchanting tooltips will show not just a single random enchantment, instead they show the <strong>Complete Outcome</strong> of the enchanting process. This feature is disabled by default.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Additionally, to enable some basic automation, <strong>Hoppers</strong> can be used to input and output items in the following ways.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Top:</strong> Input for enchantable items</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Sides:</strong> Input for lapis lazuli</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bottom:</strong> Output for enchanted items</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">And <strong>Comparators</strong> work, too! They will output a signal strength of 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the amount of lapis lazuli items placed in the table. More than 3 items don't make a difference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Bookshelves no longer require <strong>Air Blocks</strong> between themselves and the enchanting table to count towards the current enchanting power. Instead, any block without a collision box, such as water, torches, or grass can be placed in between. Also the <strong>Number Of Bookshelves</strong> required for maximum level enchantments can be configured.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üì∑ Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/490/367/2022-08-27_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/490/368/2022-08-27_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Reroll enchantments with the click of a button</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>All, one or no enchantments can be shown on the tooltip</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/490/369/2022-08-27_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/490/370/2022-08-27_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Floating rendering for enchanting table contents</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Flat rendering for enchanting table contents</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/348/779/2021-03-16_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/348/780/2021-03-16_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Enchanting with bookshelves works underwater</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>A semi-automated setup for bulk enchanting using hoppers</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üí° FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I just installed Easy Magic and it's not working!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> No new capabilities will be added to existing enchanting tables. You will need to manually break and replace the block. Same goes for converting enchanting tables back to vanilla after removing the mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: The new button for rerolling enchantments added to the enchanting screen is incompatible with my resource pack!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> The client config has an option to keep the book from the vanilla screen, the rerolling button will simply not be visible then. Rerolling still works as before, just by clicking the book now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want anvils to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Anvils</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm using Apotheosis' or Quark's enchanting system, will Easy Magic work as well?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sadly no, Easy Magic only supports the vanilla system and will be overridden by other mods introducing their own.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

(but not really)‚Ñ¢ for Blay's multiplatform mods. This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

clientside mod that changes \nelytra flight to be more fun and semi-realistic.\nIt achieves this by redesigning movement with a \ncompletely unlocked camera orientation in mind, \nallowing for full pitch, yaw and roll control in flight.\n\nSome subtle and less subtle modifiers are also applied to the camera,\nincluding but not limited to smoothing and banking.\n\n**On Fabric:**\n\n[<img alt=\"fabric-api\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/requires/fabric-api_vector.svg\">](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n[<img

[![](https://github.com/enjarai/rolling-down-in-the-deep/blob/master/img/banner-text-cropped-promo.png?raw=true)](https://modrinth.com/mod/rolling-down-in-the-deep)\n> \n> If you like Do a Barrel Roll, consider trying out [Rolling Down in the Deep](https://modrinth.com/mod/rolling-down-in-the-deep), a new addon that extends it to work while swimming underwater, even without an elytra! \n> \n> This has been in the works for quite a while, and I'm excited to finally share it. Let me know what you think on my Discord server!\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/ravine.gif)\n\n## Controls\n\nThe default controls are as follows, but can be modified:\n\n- Mouse x axis to roll\n- Mouse y axis to pitch\n- strafe keys (normally A and D) to yaw\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe mod can be configured in-game using [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl).\nOnce you install both of these,\nyou can access the config screen by finding the mod in the mods list and pressing the config button.\n\nA wide range of options are available, including custom mouse behavior, elytra activation restrictions and\nchanging values of modifiers like banking, sensitivity and more.\n\n## Server-side features\n\nVisual aspects of the mod (playermodel roll in particular) can be synced between \nclients by installing it on the server-side as well. \nEverything is still fully compatible with both vanilla clients and servers. \nAll the following configurations are valid:\n\n- Server with mod, client with mod: visuals are synced\n- Server with mod, client without mod: client can join and play without issues, but can't see visuals\n- Server without mod, client with mod: client can join and play without issues, but can only see their own visuals\n- Server with mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can see each other's visuals, client 3 cannot\n- Server without mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can only see their own visuals\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/do-a-barrel-roll.gif)\n\n## Disclaimers\n\nThis mod does not actually modify the flight physics themselves, \nso in most cases it shouldn't trigger anticheat. \nHowever, doing things like loop de loops looks to the server like rapid camera movement\nand may get you flagged.\n**Use at your own risk.**\n\n**Versions prior to 2.8.3 may not be suitable for use on multiplayer servers due to lax server-side restrictions**\n\n## Credits\n\nBased on the [Cool Elytra Roll](https://github.com/Jorbon/cool_elytra) mod by [Jorbon](https://github.com/Jorbon),\nspecifically it's \"realistic mode\".\n\nOriginally ported to Forge by [MehVahdJukaar](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar).\nModern Forge port based on [Sinytra's multiloader template](https://github.com/Sinytra/MultiLoader-Template).\n\nMod icon by

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2024-04-29T20:44:11.845709Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":6628488,"followers":9389,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE","tDFVQpHO","bAbb09VF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ZSNsJrPI","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium 0.11.2","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.11.2","changelog":"Lithium 0.11.2 for Minecraft 1.20.1 is the same as the previous release, just for 1.20.1 instead of 1.20.\n\nYou can check out all configuration options [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/blob/mc1.20.1-0.11.2/lithium-mixin-config.md).\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-12T23:58:59.682048Z","downloads":2683927,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8f4642147e60827f728badac7a819d1a9f3b25d5","sha512":"d1b5c90ba8b4879814df7fbf6e67412febbb2870e8131858c211130e9b5546e86b213b768b912fc7a2efa37831ad91caf28d6d71ba972274618ffd59937e5d0d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/versions/ZSNsJrPI/lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","filename":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","primary":true,"size":645865,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"uhPSqlnd","username":"2No2Name","name":"2No2Name","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50278648?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-31T09:13:58.517719Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"TEZXhE2U","username":"jellysquid3","name":"JellySquid","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TEZXhE2U/f4705a5f2388c65029ae2e59f1434b3e6e4de23a.png","bio":"Professional idiot at day, maniac programmer by night.","created":"2021-01-03T00:49:18.373336Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar"},"mods\\EasyAnvils-v8.0.2-1.20.1-Fabric.jar":{"sha512":"aee4e67b1f7ba7f0593a953aa1ec958cce0c9bf69df1f336b77dbd27a8264a5f886cb54fed2b19cb4d26e22236ab92d6d8bba1cdcfc1730245c63a6e867854c4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"OZBR5JT5","slug":"easy-anvils","project_type":"mod","team":"vvhQP5TS","title":"Easy Anvils","description":"Be ready for overhauled anvils!

Not only do items stay inside the interface after closing, also some annoying restrictions are removed. Also name tags can be renamed without even using an anvil.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üìö Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">First of all, anvils now have an <strong>Inventory</strong> for storing the items you put inside. This also means items will stay in the anvil after you close the interface. To put this functionality to good use, anvil contents will now <strong>Render</strong> as laying on top of the anvil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils no longer use the prior work penalty tag, so no matter how often you repair an item or add new enchantments to it, <strong>Costs Won't Needlessly Increase</strong>. You can also fully <strong>Configure The Max Level Limit</strong>, which controls when the <i>Too Expensive!</i> flag shows up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils can now be <strong>Repaired</strong> by one stage using iron blocks. You can also use a dispenser to automate repairing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Name tags have quite a few nice changes: Not only is setting a name in an anvil <strong>Completely Free</strong> and doesn't risk damaging your precious anvil, you don't even need an anvil at all anymore to change a name tag's name. Simply shift + right-click a name tag to <strong>Open A Simple Interface</strong> for setting a new name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Text Can Be Stylized</strong> using Minecraft's native formatting codes in both the anvil and name tag interface. This allows for setting custom colors and styles when choosing item and entity names.

Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

How to use\n### Keybind\nInitially, Minecraft has a keybind that overrides Zoomify by default.\nGo to the controls menu and make sure the Zoomify keybind (default `C`)\nisn't conflicting (goes red).\n\n### Open settings menu\nYou can access the settings menu with two ways.\n\n- The client command `/zoomify`\n- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) settings button\n\n## Features\n### Scroll Zoom\nYou can zoom in further using your scroll wheel.\n\n![Scroll Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/scroll-zoom-example.gif)\n\n### Spyglass Integration\nYou can configure Zoomify to only be able to zoom in when you are holding or carrying a spyglass.\nOr even just override the spyglass zoom with Zoomify!\n\nShow the spyglass overlay and play spyglass sound effects when using Zoomify.\n\n![Spyglass Integration Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/spyglass-integration-example.gif)\n\n### Transitions\n**14 different** transitions to choose from!\n\n- Instant\n- Linear\n- [Ease in Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInSine)\n- [Ease out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeOutSine)\n- [Ease in/out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInOutSine)\n- [Ease in Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInQuad)\n- [Ease out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeOutQuad)\n- [Ease in/out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInOutQuad)\n- [Ease in Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInCubic)\n- [Ease out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeOutCubic)\n- [Ease in/out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInOutCubic)\n- [Ease in Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInExp)\n- [Ease out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeOutExp)\n- [Ease in/out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInOutExp)\n\nYou can even pick what transition you would like for zooming in and out individually!\n\n![Individual Transition Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/individual-transition.png)\n\n### Relative Sensitivity\nReduce your mouse sensitivity based on the amount of zoom,\nso you have fine control over your player.\n\n![Relative Sensitivity Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-sensitivity-example.gif)\n\n### Relative View Bobbing\nReduce the view bobbing effect based on the amount of zoom,\nso you can walk and zoom at the same time!\n\n![Relative View Bobbing Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-view-bobbing-example.gif)\n\n### Cinematic Camera\nMake the mouse/camera smooth, like the zoom in [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net).\n\n![Cinematic Cam Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/cinematic-cam-example.gif)\n\n### Affect Hand FOV\nTurn off this setting to prevent your hand from also being zoomed in!\n\n![Affect Hand FOV Turned Off Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/affect-hand-fov-disabled-example.gif)\n\n### Secondary Zoom\n\nCompletely separate zoom from normal Zoomify.\nAimed for content creators, features `Hide HUD While Zooming` option and longer zoom in times.\n\n![Secondary Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/secondary-zoom.gif)\n\n### Presets\n\nYou can reset to default, make Zoomify behave like OptiFine and others!\n\n### Smart Keybinding Detection\n\nOn first launch, if a keybinding is conflicting with Zoomify's zoom, a notification will appear notifying them of this.\n\n![Keybinding Conflict Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/keybind-conflict-detection.png)\n\n### Highly configurable\nAbsolutely **NO** hard-coded values. Everything about your zoom is configurable!\n\n### Control the zoom speed with seconds\nInstead of some stupid arbitrary value such as zoom speed, you can pick\nthe exact amount of seconds it will take to zoom in, with a separate setting for zooming out.\n\n### Credits\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - Developer\n- [MoonTidez](https://github.com/MoonTidez) - Logo designer\n\n####

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first.

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it.

All leaves are gone after about one second (configurable). That's it, nothing special about it so far!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üìö Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Why another leaf decay mod? Aren't there like a dozen already?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure, but this one is different for sure.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Out Of The Box Mod Compat:</strong> All mods that register their leaves in the <code>minecraft:leaves</code> tag are automatically supported, even when their leaves don't extend vanilla Minecraft's leaves block (e.g. some of the large trees in the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrestria\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Terrestria</span></a> mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/coderbot\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">coderbot</span></a>).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>No Additional Block Updates/Block State Checks:</strong> Leaves Be Gone is extremely efficient when determining which leaves blocks to accelerate decay for. It hooks in just where vanilla decides when a leaves block is able to decay, so it doesn't have to do any calculations on it's own. Also no additional calculations are made elsewhere, like when harvesting logs or when other leaves blocks decay as in other mods.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Works Properly Across Chunk/Level Reloads:</strong> Scheduled leaf decays are stored using Minecraft's native system for scheduling ticks (no custom hacky solution required!), so when undloading and reloading the area leaf decay continues as it should without having to repeat any calculations.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üì∑ Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/813/2022-10-06_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/814/2022-10-06_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Redwood tree leaves be gone!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>So many drops!</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üí° FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;

filled one with your bare hands? Well, wonder no more!\n\nCarry On is a simple mod that improves game interaction by allowing players to pick up, carry, and place single block Tile Entities (such as Chests, Furnaces, Droppers, Spawners, and your favorite machines from other Tech Mods) using only their empty hands. No items (or pickaxes) required. States, meta data, inventory and NBT data are retained. It also allows you to carry around smaller mobs!\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n- Shift (can be rebound) + Right-Click (with Empty Hands) on any Tile Entity or mob to lift and carry\n- Right-Click to place\n\n![Carry On Demo](https://www.creeptech.net/carryon/carryondemo2.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/PJ4Q7tp.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/czlzu1s.gif)\n\n\n**Other features:**\n\n- Works with single block Tile Entities from any mod (yes, tech mods too)\n- Works with all entities (no hostile mobs in survival mode, configurable)\n- Entities can be stacked on each other (only smaller entities on top of larger ones)\n- Respects the ‚Äòlock‚Äô functionality so Tile Entities cannot be stolen\n- Powerful config allows you to blacklist entire mods or specific blocks, and additional customization\n- Players can only carry one Tile Entity or Mob at a time, and are prevented from other actions when carrying\n- Carrying a Tile Entity or Mob slows the player. Items with fuller inventories and larger mobs will cause additional slowness\n- Advanced scripting for modpack creators. Wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Scripting).\n- If you can't place down a picked up block, you can remove it from your inventory with /carryon clear\n- Players can also be carried\n\n**Config Options:**\n\n- Carry On provides a powerful config file, wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Model-Override-Config)\n- Specific blocks or entire mods can be blacklisted\n- An option to carry standard blocks (e.g., Dirt) can be enabled (Default = Off)","published":"2022-12-05T21:45:11.691063Z","updated":"2024-02-27T22:40:49.584973Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":815592,"followers":815,"categories":["game-mechanics","storage","transportation"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["WaUwGT7r","aPthYrcV","4taUKxre","ibq5WYnJ","IA7TXsjL","CGK8S9Jc","FS0TPQOn","HMCz7mpi","Tpvzh1n7","CS0T5Zjr","HSrAkWqH","fk6vR3rB","zFYERXVc","F6ZR4jay","QAiSN3Q8","IJ5gr5ow","cE4GdBxS","67jN6bxd","SXmDVLN0","4GE3aVyX","o4LGtvUQ","2jx3bUuL","BycIzhuF","uGbxgawj","LwNYnVxa","NyGIRVfz","1soFLh2H","gq4gg8ZY","fgecxyFN","TNZ4Ah0o","epf47Jaz","f48u7DLZ","i8cp4wxM","u8IQu6NU","TxQzQgUm","tofYc8B0","aKYuUZpd","5QeqM4nf","fg9VeABy","nc5Z9l3C","x5FGVS4q","LTOqV1Cw","iX4EV3eP","9iomDg8D","uemV3oEm","uh2S7w5K","tHTJYcot","e6FYVr4k","6pIQMDen","SgeYUS6n","edGQD16r","Mkla4B3q","AlPBrFTW","CE3MquDi","J7qT9hJD","DjVumdix","EvDx8gEe","8a6KfB5j"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/d07cc032da5a9854489ab5ae443c91c1147792bc.png"},"version":{"id":"Mkla4B3q","project_id":"joEfVgkn","author_id":"5I09DlLz","featured":false,"name":"Carry On 2.1.2.7","version_number":"2.1.2.7","changelog":"- Fixed Memory Leak\n- Updated default Blacklist\n- Fixed crash with Rats","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-19T22:29:43.157958Z","downloads":353585,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ca96f56dba50ea4827ec7a15bc590ccb29aba01896550d3cb398bed18acdf469dd351cdc9312e4743f54955b3162e744c58d76c88eb79b1e5e5b4570f5b33c64","sha1":"8f3858977becfbc26f67f4a5579881e15e07d69d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/versions/Mkla4B3q/carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","filename":"carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","primary":true,"size":443033,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4y59IILI","user":{"id":"5I09DlLz","username":"Tschipp","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649893?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-05T21:43:38.882316Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar"},"mods\\starlight-1.1.2+fabric.dbc156f.jar":{"sha512":"6b0e363fc2d6cd2f73b466ab9ba4f16582bb079b8449b7f3ed6e11aa365734af66a9735a7203cf90f8bc9b24e7ce6409eb04d20f84e04c7c6b8e34f4cc8578bb","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"H8CaAYZC","slug":"starlight","project_type":"mod","team":"DXoc0ko3","title":"Starlight (Fabric)","description":"Rewrites the light engine to fix lighting performance and lighting errors","body":"Starlight\n==================\nFabric mod for rewriting the light engine to fix lighting performance and lighting errors.\n\nFuture updates past 1.20\n------------------\nPlease see: https://gist.github.com/Spottedleaf/6cc1acdd03a9b7ac34699bf5e8f1b85c\nThis project will not receive further updates for the foreseeable future.\n\nCompatibility\n------------------\nStarlight can be installed either on the dedicated server or client. It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20.

The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ‚ö° Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ‚ö° Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you‚Äôd like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2024-05-06T17:10:49.440737Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1167555,"followers":839,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX","8ZQqfeXy","3FEq2lT7","FeV5OquF","iKVUNCME","i3FZxFQO","h0hKeaRD","85t1ZpLC","vl2NraaO"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"XGW2fviP","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":false,"name":"1.10.53 (Fabric 1.20.1)","version_number":"1.10.53-fabric","changelog":"This update brings the latest version of spark for Minecraft 1.20.1 to Modrinth.

No nerfing or changing of recipes, same ore generation as vanilla (small patches of ores), ...\n* MI doesn't have the annoying crafting tools. No need to craft a new hammer/wrench/file/mortar/... every 20 recipes.\n* MI has a very powerful pipe system that allows you to automate your setups very early. No need to grind for hours without any automation.\n* MI is very resource-hungry, but you'll get a quarry very early that will entirely remove your need for mining if you care to automate it.\n* MI doesn't have 10 tiers of every possible machine, instead it uses an original overclock system allowing multiblocks to reach 1 craft / tick provided you have enough energy.\n\n</details>\n","published":"2021-01-27T10:08:47.432246Z","updated":"2024-05-26T11:01:50.028386Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":140990,"followers":217,"categories":["storage","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18-rc3","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","neoforge"],"versions":["kBojwQ1i","RBaDe5i1","JbxZWDel","STzaGH8b","KMmNxfZV","QBfJcUlc","J2cvlSJR","vcBX9B6F","hYs7Q3FL","1T8ek5D2","w3Oyjx05","pJ2TUBe5","xsCmq6fF","pgFgbVEO","nJaCrllo","LYinh00h","g0orNo56","Wz5HOZZ0","8RCo0mIS","mJ5ZEphZ","MOQFxOZE","A1yWfREG","Ep0CnTFg","8JaRGLEP","W9s772LY","74Fr0Br4","1Gr8mg4d","olPJIMz4","I5tCkOxx","Imjfy4Zc","S7tjtpby","Tfk1ufM1","hXlyotXQ","rPiUix8v","voemlndH","M2Fbmma9","UrbCm3o1","XkRitrFB","j47dSPkc","gQ4OZTZZ","vMyJTmiN","88A9HnvA","7Wa0X74x","dkCIgQuI","yiDK9P09","4TdGTZx2","AgAQLQUK","tWVUekp5","LE5GGqkX","XY13dUKH","B7LMSeGI","cvBY8N2l","N6PaHUkT","wDoZGczq","cKgnQ9EB","U9PAlcvt","JFVJZ5Y3","LyX6otLv","ZZpNyAwp","h2e8BwBL","5vZ0kTYP","guzxC1K0","LaozcdwV","4aMaIuZb","E3hyv2Tc","Wx2YFTRo","RWdXZNT1","RwHiuD8l","1jgLuy1O","Qw2Y5gWk","HBadoENo","vXzUOjFF","5Jos0it7","PVJ6ZlPT","ZYfj9vpk","FHg8vKKG","f5qHyUJa","FVf97avi","la9De3fI","AWkVuOOT","S8WkHizf","mpSnFo6i","TKqqz4S2","n7DVhLa1","1fphN2Zt","kG5fAj8t","KD6O4xgu","nGvJOo39","Hv9olPbj","Z3KNwzqV","TMYCbp0E","hnSXTMX3","e2H0S6ZN","ymccRNls","60gt0cBw","KhhwRkNB","cJOYK8Hb","ApwJhYPr","c5o9kG0J"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Gov5Dboq/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"cJOYK8Hb","project_id":"Gov5Dboq","author_id":"twx512Yz","featured":false,"name":"Modern Industrialization v1.8.5","version_number":"1.8.5","changelog":"Please visit our github repository for a changelog: https://github.com/AztechMC/Modern-Industrialization/releases.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-25T20:42:09.329984Z","downloads":1036,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"5ad842dbb01844da929474415f643172b85964c3","sha512":"39d27edadc211c410bfbb2587c66382f5cc16ef78f9113700c44e1ac6a4788163a0819899f2a0f0c6e92ca787f48ea58433efd2c061ea7b46b148ec2359af203"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Gov5Dboq/versions/cJOYK8Hb/Modern-Industrialization-1.8.5.jar","filename":"Modern-Industrialization-1.8.5.jar","primary":true,"size":7223151,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"6AQIaxuO","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Hv40r83o","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"embedded"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"fRiHVvU7","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"nU0bVIaL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"embedded"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"nfn13YXA","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"u6dRKJwZ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"YTv828hq","user":{"id":"afdbywvp","username":"Azercoco","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425137?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-27T10:18:54.320880Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Author","ordering":0},{"team_id":"YTv828hq","user":{"id":"twx512Yz","username":"Technici4n","name":"Technici4n","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13494793?v=4","bio":"Bruno Ploumhans","created":"2021-01-27T10:04:26.396343Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Modern-Industrialization-1.8.5.jar"},"mods\\BOMD-1.7.5-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"4455247f1652cf097bdab445467d7ab1f1ae58c6b594de0ef5118fc908e32ca888110be4036dd941256d3a9574993f8b1122a4a6f90d195e2f142f16f31227a7","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"du3UfiLL","slug":"bosses-of-mass-destruction","project_type":"mod","team":"WtNpzxM2","title":"Bosses of Mass Destruction","description":"Adds boss fights to minecraft","body":"## Are you looking to add some more exciting boss fights to your world?

you change the size of most entities, shrinking them smaller or growing them larger","body":"&nbsp;  \nThis mod allows for most entities to have their size changed, either enlarging or shrinking them.  \n&nbsp;  \nIt also provides an API that other mods can make use of to manipulate the size of entities and the time it takes for their size to change.  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \nThe Quilt/Fabric version is the actively supported version and will receive features, updates, and fixes first. The NeoForge and Forge versions are not supported as actively.  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \nFor the ***Quilt/Fabric*** version, the ***most recently released jar*** can be used on: ***1.20.4, 1.20.2, 1.20.1, 1.19.4, 1.19.2, 1.18.2, 1.17.1, 1.16.5, 1.15.2, and 1.14.4***.  \nFor the ***NeoForge*** version, there are ***separate jars*** for each supported Minecraft version. Those jars are for: ***1.20.4 and 1.20.2***.  \nFor the ***Forge*** version, there are ***separate jars*** for each supported Minecraft version. Those jars are for: ***1.20.1, 1.19.4, 1.19.2, 1.18.2, 1.17.1, and 1.16.5***.  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \nRemoving this mod will revert entities back to their normal size. Adding it back in will ***not*** restore their size.  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \nIf you have no mods that add ways to rescale entities, you can modify and view the scale and scaling delay of an entity in-game using the `/scale` command if you have operator permissions:  \n&nbsp;  \n`/scale set <value> [entity]`  \n`/scale set <scale_type> <value> [entity]`  \n`/scale <add|subtract|multiply|divide> <value> [entity]`  \n`/scale <add|subtract|multiply|divide> <scale_type> <value> [entity]`  \n`/scale get [entity]`  \n`/scale get <scale_type> [entity]`  \n`/scale compute <scale_type> [entity]`

\n`/scale reset <scale_type> [entity]`  \n`/scale nbt get [entity]`  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \nIf you want your scale to persist after you respawn, there's a `/scale` subcommand for that as well:  \n&nbsp;  \n`/scale persist set <true|false> [entity]`  \n`/scale persist set <scale_type> <true|false> [entity]`  \n`/scale persist get <scale_type> [entity]`  \n`/scale persist reset [entity]`  \n`/scale persist reset <scale_type> [entity]`  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \nThe following scale types are added by default:  \n&nbsp;  \n`pehkui:base`: Generic scale type for easily affecting other scales

Add-on for Spell Engine","body":"\nTHIS IS A FABRIC MOD\n\n \n\nThis mod requires the following:\n\nArchitectury\n\nGeckolib\n\nSpell Power\n\nSpell Engine\n\nRunes\n\nPlayer-Animator\n\n \n\nIt is VERY RECOMMENDED to use the following with this mod:\n\nBetter Combat\n\nAdaptive Tooltips\n\nWizards\n\n \n\nTo put spells on your Spellblade or other spell host, put the item in a Spell Binding Table with bookshelves around it like an Enchantment Table.\n\nA cheaper way to get Rune Ingots involves casting spells with the corresponding block of metal....\n\n \n\nThis mod adds spellblades, magical claymores, and magic orbs to the game, each of which have different pools of magical spells to cast.\n\n \n\nSpellblades deal 2/3 of your corresponding spell attribute as extra damage of that type with melee attacks, and can host spells that are close range and quick to cast.\n\n \n\nClaymores deal 100% of your corresponding spell attribute as extra damage of that type with melee attacks, can't be dual wielded, and have similar spells to Spellblades but with more area of effect or projectile count. They come pre-stocked with a spin attack (spell) of their respective element.\n\n \n\nOrbs deal no extra damage and have spells that don't do a whole lot of damage, but the spells have incredible area of effect or versatility.\n\n \n\nRunic Armor gives you a bonus to its respective damage type, in addition to giving you an amount of absorption proportional to the amount of runic armor pieces you're wearing, 5 seconds after all your absorption depletes.\n\n \n\nThis mod also adds the Hexblade faction, which has a chance to invade proportional to how much magic damage you've dealt recently. At the beginning of a potential invasion, you are sent a scout that offers you a way out of the invasion. If you buy their goods, you can be spared. You can't be invaded if you've been invaded or sent a scout recently, but this grace period can get cut shorter if you cast a lot of spells during its time. (Older versions of the mod simply have them invade right away, if you are having invasions unprompted update the mod)\n\n \n\nHexblade enemies can rarely drop a Prismatic Effigy, which summons Magus, if Magus is not already present in the world. Magus only takes one type of damage at a time, corresponding to whatever damage he is doing at the time. This is indicated by the colors of his robes and the element of his spellblade. All other damagetypes are resisted by 95%.  Magus drops a piece of their Primordial Robes upon death.\n\n \n\nDisable Hexblade by typing /gamerule hexbladeInvade false.\n\n \n\nThe Primordial set has a similar but stronger absorption mechanic to Runic Armor, with the extra effect of triggering elemental novas with a frequency proportional to your amount of the Primordial set worn.\n\n ","published":"2023-04-19T23:42:11.426038Z","updated":"2024-05-31T16:28:50.100250Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":167866,"followers":43,"categories":["equipment","magic"],"additional_categories":["adventure","mobs"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["1RmAodX6","rZnJbEKf","xcVBigGH","TcDojLGl","V0996g4n","Hr8qvvuq","jOe5mgg8","f5cA0oNm","lC6HEkuk","clj7Dkig","5ZTja0VI","NlxdVZ7w","WkQkKmJU","SZ85vKZ2","NqMUd7lu","FfGYlaxg","5L89LTQP","csO9pXh5","4H03B2MS","7ICi153w","L0gP90iM","KmvtCn5w","62iiuM65","wOgteZ6t","5dnCu2gw","gN4hJo8p","EhhuyOF5","MiZfAQ0R","LLOBuNd4","YD862eFb","XWyUxmFh","hLkKNLTn","j4DEF4vv","gSSZkbFQ","yvAVZit5","eZmAJx0k","4Rmje8iV","ySJIvYiD","MXGhZW65","mnKyNvdb","M8X6zvl5","WiEShoiD","uBreIzKv","wRC5myix","21Zi5lDT","EL0JYZad","Fx9u7Tvx","NCqgiihL","vmMgfk4g","BiDPneRT","lQwrd0gY"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VJkx9nDN/b0483a1e4b78b8f331c0e2a84c9a3b5605f8e3e9.png"},"version":{"id":"lQwrd0gY","project_id":"VJkx9nDN","author_id":"LxNiPjoc","featured":false,"name":"Spellblades and Such 1.15.2","version_number":"1.15.2","changelog":"Caught up with Curseforge.

Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine? [Check out this list!](https://optifine.alternatives.lambdaurora.dev/)\n\n## ‚úÖ Features:\n\n- Dynamic lights.\n- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.\n- Works with some modded items.\n- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!\n- Magma cubes emit light.\n- Spectral arrows emit light.\n- Burning entities emit light.\n- Blazes emit light.\n- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.\n- Quick and simple API for developers.\n- And more!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Items emit light\n\nDropped items which already emit light as a block, will also dynamically emit light!\n\n![Torch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/21/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Held items emit light\n\nLight is emitted when entities hold light emitting items.\n\n![Fox holding lantern](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/22/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Fire!

Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## üìñ How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## üìñ Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# üìñ Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.\n- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.\n- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n\n\n**<p

Enjoy playing in third person view. :)\n### Natural look and feel\nAttacks have an upswing phase before the hit is actually performed, like in real life.\n### Weapon combos\nSome weapons have a sequence of different attacks.\n### Dual wielding\nDual wield any one handed weapons! Use the attack hotkey to alternately attack with main-hand and off-hand.\n### Reworked Sweeping Edge\nWeapon swing hitting multiple enemies deal reduced damage. To deal full weapon damage against all targets, you need to have Sweeping Edge enchantment.\n### Hold to attack\nHold the attack hotkey to spam attacks on cooldown (configurable).\n### Swing thru grass\nAttack instead of mining zero hardness blocks (configurable).\n### Support any item from any mod (with data files)\nAutomatic compatibility with most mods (weapons without attribute file, will be automatically assigned a matching weapon preset, based on item id).\n\nSuper easy to add dedicated compatibility, support via Discord for partnering modders.\n\n&zwnj;\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# üî® Add compatibility to any weapon\n&zwnj;\n\nAdd uniquely created or out of the box behaviour to any weapon from any mod, by just creating **JSON** data files.\n\nCheck out our integration guide [here](https://github.com/ZsoltMolnarrr/BetterCombat#-integrate-your-mod \"integration guide\").\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# üîß Configuration\n&zwnj;\n\n**Client side** settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n**Server side** config can be found at:\n\n- General properties: `config/bettercombat/server.conf`\n\n- Fallback compatibility: `config/bettercombat/fallback_config.conf`\n\nAutomatically created with default values, upon loading any game world for the first time. \n\n&zwnj;\n\n# ‚õì Compatibility\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWith an open source and modular mindset, this project is aiming for maximal compatibility.

How does it work?:</summary>\n\nUsually when playing Minecraft, your armor bar will only consist of up to 10 silver armor icons.<br>\nThese 10 icons allow Minecraft to display up to 20 armor points.\nBut sometimes, when playing with mods or LuckyBlocks, displaying up to 20 points is simply not enough.<br>\nThat's when ArmorPoints++'s colored icons come into place!<br>\nThey allow up to 240 armor points to be displayed within your armor bar.<br>\nThere are a total of 12 different colors your armor bar can have (including the vanilla one).<br>\nBelow will be an overview of all the colors; you'll see in-game screenshots over at the [screenshots-tab on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/armorpoints/screenshots).<br><br>\n\n![silver armor](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/armor_blank.png)<br>\nThis icon looks like the vanilla one, because it is exactly that. No additional meaning, no hidden things, just up to 20 plain armor points as you're used to see.<br><br>\n![orange armor](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/armor_orange.png)<br>\nNow it's getting interesting... When you see this icon in your armor bar, your armor exceeded the mark of 20 points.<br><br>\n![yellow armor](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/armor_yellow.png)<br>\nAnd just like orange, this one is just displaying a higher armor value. In this case, it is 41 - 60 points.<br><br>\n![lime armor](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/armor_lime.png)<br>\nThis icon tells you that you're reached the area of 61 - 80 armor points.<br><br>\n![green armor](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/armor_green.png)<br>\nYou've nearly reached the 100 points mark when you see this icon in your armor bar.<br><br>\n![turquoise armor](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/armor_turquoise.png)<br>\nAnd now... now what? Does there even exist armor that gives you more than 100 points? Sadly yes, otherwise this mod would be pretty useless, wouldn't it?<br><br>\n![cyan armor](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/armor_cyan.png)<br>\nI don't even know why we're here... 121 - 140 points is an incredible amount, right?<br><br>\n![light blue armor](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/armor_light_blue.png)<br>\nI think I just did this color to fill up some empty space in my texture file... but it also displays 141 - 160 points!<br><br>\n![blue armor](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/armor_blue.png)<br>\nNow we're nearing the end of my icon pallet. 161 - 180 points! We've nearly done it! Just some more!<br><br>\n![purple armor](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/armor_purple.png)<br>\nOk, why are you even doing this now? Is there any point of having 181 - 200 armor points?<br><br>\n![pink armor](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/armor_pink.png)<br>\nI think you're overdoing it a little... you already turned invincible at 25 points, but now... now you got over 200 of them!<br><br>\n![red armor](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/armor_red.png)<br>\nAt this point even I stopped doing more icons, because... which <em>sane</em> human would create armor that gives you 221 - 240 points???\n</details><br>\n\n<details>\n<summary>You said something about resistance borders?:</summary>\n\nYeah, when turned on and if you have the minecraft:resistance effect, you'll see a faint red border around your armor bar.<br>\nEach 2 icons surrounded by this border indicate one level of the effect, because... you really turn invincible at resistance 5!<br>\n![resistance borders](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/resistance.png)<br>\n<span style=\"font-size: 5px;\">Example for resistance 3 at 7 armor points. Note: How many icons get shown for a resistance of 1 can be set in the config.</span>\n</details><br>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Armor Toughness overlay? Yes - it's here!</summary>\n\nYour very precious armor toughness will get shown as an overlay on top of your armor bar. Awesome!<br>\nWhenever you see two of these little icons, you know that you got 1 or 2 (rounded up) points of armor toughness.<br>\n![toughness overlay  ](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/toughness.png)<br>\n![toughness overlay 2](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/toughness_2.png)<br>\n<span style=\"font-size: 5px;\">Yeah. That's about it... not that spectacular, really. Note: How many icons get shown for a toughness of 1 can be set in the config. -- As of v3.0.0, these icons also use color to indicate stacked icons</span>\n</details><br>\n\n<details>\n<summary>An independent Armor Toughness bar? It exists!</summary>\n\nIf you don't like the adorable little overlay icons explained above, you can switch them out for a whole new bar whose sole purpose is displaying your Armor Toughness value.<br>\nIn terms of color, it behaves exactly the same as armor - so look it up if you've forgotten it!<br>\n![toughness icon](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/toughness_blank.png)<br>\n<span style=\"font-size: 5px;\">Soooo... i was lazy and only put one icon here... don't worry though, the mod includes all of them!</span>\n</details><br>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Protection as an overlay? You can now see it without even opening your inventory!</summary>\n\nThese overlays will show the combined value of all types of protection (Fire Protection, Protection, etc.) on your armor items.<br>\nSimilar to armor toughness, one icon shows a value of 1 or 2 (rounded up) of combined protection.<br>\n![protection overlay](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/protection.png)<br>\n<span style=\"font-size: 5px;\">Quite shiny, isn't it? Note: How many icons get shown for a protection of 1 can be set in the config.</span>\n</details><br>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Multiple health bars in one? What do the colors mean?:</summary>\n\nWhen playing Minecraft, you sometimes get extra hp through the <code>minecraft:health_boost</code> effects or some other mod.<br>\nThose hearts then get displayed as an additional bar, if that gets filled up, a third bar gets added and so on.<br>\nHealth stacking completely removes those additional health bars and replaces them with one single, colored one.<br>\nUsing this feature of ArmorPoints++ will ensure that your screen is never cluttered with too many hearts.<br><br>\n\n![red heart](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/heart_red.png)<br>\nThose hearts really are something! When you get a lot of these red little beasts, they usually clutter your screen. With this mod, you only get to see red hearts when you have 1 - 20 hp.<br><br>\n![orange heart](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/heart_orange.png)<br>\nOrange hearts, much like the orange armor icon, show you that you have more hearts than usual. 21 - 40 in this case.<br><br>\n![yellow heart](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/heart_yellow.png)<br>\nYellow it is! You have now 41 - 60 hp.<br><br>\n![lime heart](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/heart_lime.png)<br>\nLime reminds me of life. And you have a lot of it. [ 61 - 80 hp ]<br><br>\n![green heart](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/heart_green.png)<br>\nGreen seems a little boring after all those flashy colors... and still, it exists! [ 81 - 100 hp ]<br><br>\n![turquoise heart](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/heart_turquoise.png)<br>\n'Turquoise'... what an odd name for a color... but it tells you that you have now more than 100 hp!<br><br>\n![cyan heart](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/heart_cyan.png)<br>\nGood ol' cyan... how nice to have 121 - 140 hp.<br><br>\n![light blue heart](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/heart_light_blue.png)<br>\nBlue, like water, right? But you won't drown today, 'cause you got yourself 141 - 160 hp!<br><br>\n![blue heart](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/heart_blue.png)<br>\nAnother shade of blue, ha? Mabe you'll drown now, now that you've gone so deep into the water that you can't even see the sun anymore. [ 161 - 180 hp ]<br><br>\n![purple heart](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/heart_purple.png)<br>\nAaaah... purple... what a nice feeling to see nearly 200 hp in one health bar!<br><br>\n![pink heart](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/heart_pink.png)<br>\nAnd now, well... there aren't any more colors left... more than 200 - 220 hp will be shown by this little pink heart :)\n</details><br>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Where did my absorption hearts go?:</summary>\nDo not worry, my friend, Your absorption hearts aren't gone!<br>\nThey just moved.<br>\nYou can now find them as a border around your hearts.<br>\nEach pixel of your heart border displays 4 absorption hp [ = 2 absorption hearts ], making it 80 absorption points per heart border or 800 [ = 400 absorption hearts ] for your entire health bar.<br>\n\n![absorption  1](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/absorption_1.png)<br>\n![absorption  2](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/absorption_2.png)<br>\n![absorption  3](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/absorption_3.png)<br>\n![absorption  4](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/absorption_4.png)<br>\n![absorption  5](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/absorption_5.png)<br>\n![absorption 18](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/absorption_18.png)<br>\n![absorption 19](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/absorption_19.png)<br>\n![absorption 20](https://img.cheos.dev/appp/absorption_20.png)<br>\n<span style=\"font-size: 5px;\">Some examples for absorption borders on vanilla hearts [ I won't put all of them here, making all those individual images took long enough ] Note: How many pixels get shown for one absorption heart can be set in the config.</span>\n</details><br>\n\n<details>\n<summary>You said, I could see absolute health/armor values?:</summary>\n\nYeah. Your armor, health and absorption values get shown as text beneath their respective bar in your HUD.<br>\nIf you want to see this in-game, I recommend checking out the [screenshots-tab on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/armorpoints/screenshots)</a>.<br>\n<span style=\"font-size: 5px;\">Shhh! Let me tell you a secret: You can turn this off in the config if you don't like it, and you can even configure every color of the text!</span>\n</details><br>\n\nFully configurable? Let me see the config!<br>\nThey are all available [here](https://config.cheos.dev/appp/). Honestly. Better click that link now! (obviously, I'm joking - you don't have to)<br><br>\n\n<details>\n<summary>FAQ [ please read before asking anything ]:</summary>\n\nWhy did you create this mod?\n- Well... I was playing a lot of LuckyBlocks and I just couldn't find any good mods (in 1.8) for doing what Armorpoints++ does, so I created one myself. - I hope, you like it!\n\nWhy aren't there any versions before 1.1.1?\n- So... about that... There was a lot of internal testing going on and I didn't name those test versions beta or so, so the first release just happened to be v1.1.1.\n\nWhy isn't &lt;version&gt; supported?\n- I just so happen to be human and don't want to bother with too many different versions, so I'll mostly just update for the forge LTS version and for the latest version of Minecraft.\n\nCan you implement &lt;feature&gt;? [ Is there anything missing you want to see in this mod? ]\n- Open a new Issue [here](https://github.com/Cheos137/ArmorpointsPlusplus/issues) using the \"Feature request\"-Template, if the feature fits this mod, I'll happily implement it for all supported versions.\n \nCan you port this mod to &lt;version&gt;?\n- Head over to [https://github.com/users/Cheos137/projects/1](https://github.com/users/Cheos137/projects/1) - if the version you'd like to see this mod ported to is not there (and not in the unsupported column), ask me UNLESS there is already a comment/feature request/etc. asking for specifically that version.\n- If I happen to get annoyed from being asked to port to one version over and over, I'll delay porting or won't port at all.\n\nI found a bug, what should I do?\n- Open a new Issue [here](https://github.com/Cheos137/ArmorpointsPlusplus/issues) using the \"Bug report\"-Template, I'll then see what I can do.\n\nWhy doesn't the banner match the in-game color order?\n- History. Check the changelog of v3.0.0 and you'll see.\n\nResource pack support?\n- `[< v2.0.0]` If you're making a resourcepack that supports this mod, you'll have to override the\n    - `armorplusplus:textures/gui/armor.png` and the\n    - `armorplusplus:textures/gui/health.png` texture.\n- `[v2.0.0+]` As of v2.0.0, both atlases mentioned above are merged into one single file:\n    - `armorpointspp:textures/gui/icons.png`\n- I know this is not perfectly ideal, but I don't intend to overlay a color above the vanilla icons because it would limit my possibilities.\n- `[v3.0.0+]` As of v3.0.0, custom atlases are supported.<br>Texture atlases can be added by resource packs by adding a texture atlas matching the same layout and aspect ratio at assets/armorpointspp/textures/gui/&lt;atlas_name&gt;.png<br>Of course, &lt;atlas_name&gt; has to be replaced by some meaningful name. (this name must be unique)<br>This texture atlas can then be enabled by setting the textureSheet option to &lt;atlas_name&gt; in the ArmorPoints++ config file.\n\nNeed further support?\n- You can join my mod support discord [here: https://discord.gg/rBmVqjrazz](https://discord.gg/rBmVqjrazz)\n\nMay I use this mod in my Modpack?\n- If it gets published on CurseForge and/or Modrinth: Yes, of course, I'd appreciate it - If it gets published on any 3rd-party site: Please ask me before using my mod in your Modpack.\n</details>\n","published":"2022-06-11T19:45:22.003494Z","updated":"2023-12-24T21:46:54.224881Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":31701,"followers":70,"categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["RsfhM7ap","BZHRQUfw","pd2wiB46","PgSRzpUQ","ZAAMEeUV","szOAm5hT","N9WVXXRi","VSFZvWcO","l2soOHb2","tiF9fPv4","fwYV1Q4d","oHSbrdPF","O6GteZ3c","TXzMPwTs","XYBnWHxd","XkuZbwoc","EnzXnRub","igo7Sh54","ratNCv1G","doAXdjqn","3NpVE5wf","meONww6S","TDTNaTQt","WQJuJmfA","QSXtSxlx","bLWDIXal","Njo0yfC7","oK3I8YOl","3FoOzKVP","frJGwns0","50JMpTaz","TO7HWZy5","TLxWZ0Ls","HwPjxror","pfHvYYgw","HM0hAiuH","G66xGiej","7gRNIgVq","DCRckWDi","Uf0tqswT","44Sm8tOg","NJD8sOJg","Ob9mSaEO","xBkzBfYL","OW3S86E5","WpH7eMGq","66ulbdfo","FJl8n6Lp","Oa7j459D","hyLv68O0"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/xvAim1vw/a6b37ee975be4120f4d61cc28887279c9a362dc9.png"},"version":{"id":"NJD8sOJg","project_id":"xvAim1vw","author_id":"fiNGZVfu","featured":false,"name":"v3.1.2 [FABRIC 1.20]","version_number":"fabric-1.20-3.1.2","changelog":"- fixed libhud compat","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-31T09:44:05.415629Z","downloads":6186,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"987a2e76fe844c8af679e598cf13f2ca10c14882","sha512":"1f2ac484dc5f29d1d8372edef52314eaac71d2fe6798c355aac5d1232d7375197fdbb587ac46b97b76df7d39b2c178c329b183f560a68d1ff881b0d0f9331d91"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/xvAim1vw/versions/NJD8sOJg/armorpointspp-fabric-1.20-3.1.2.jar","filename":"armorpointspp-fabric-1.20-3.1.2.jar","primary":true,"size":445379,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"JSEqc95y","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"24v1cPBp","user":{"id":"mQUflkfU","username":"SopsyHallow","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91166883?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-11-27T16:16:15.462829Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"24v1cPBp","user":{"id":"fiNGZVfu","username":"Cheos","name":"Cheos","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/fiNGZVfu/icon.png","bio":"https://discord.gg/rBmVqjrazz","created":"2022-06-11T19:18:28.868820Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"armorpointspp-fabric-1.20-3.1.2.jar"},"mods\\netherportalfix-fabric-1.20-13.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"14c672b56c9ec7a057711be28b53d974a502941f0a6a2a5ab6f5d8e8d7fa26481d7ab23b518eb36838bf59da78cc92f7840f983d15576194866a4afe94f9f39b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"nPZr02ET","slug":"netherportalfix","project_type":"mod","team":"wvv5zQj8","title":"NetherPortalFix","description":"Ensures correct destinations when travelling back and forth through Nether Portals in Multiplayer.","body":"![](https://blay09.net/files/brand/netherportalfix.png)\n\n[![](https://mods.twelveiterations.com/img/sponsor.png)](https://mods.twelveiterations.com/sponsor)\n\nEver played on a multiplayer server, built near other players and when returning from the Nether, surprisingly found yourself in another player's base?

addon providing support for the Fabric Rendering API, based on Indigo","body":"Indium is an addon for the rendering optimisation mod [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), providing support for the Fabric Rendering API. The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2024-02-06T00:32:19.293889Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4923070,"followers":5967,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9","tD2IqHXC","nTorcOMQ","Aouse6P7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Aouse6P7","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.30 for Minecraft 1.20.x/Sodium 0.5.8/Fabric API 0.89+","version_number":"1.0.30+mc1.20.4","changelog":"- Also allow 1.20.1 (fixes #277) (comp500)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.30+mc1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-06T00:32:27.223998Z","downloads":1623953,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"3b9c9beef42f72bc75094595c92038c38e36fcde75890c73ced01aed4fb2a8a85cddb8edd2aa91ea6ed2dd41f8afedaa3dbca8f70c716197a7f2ee5b26060562","sha1":"b24233f29c0ce4802c61ea8998e01e6e4580ae60"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/Aouse6P7/indium-1.0.30%2Bmc1.20.4.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.30+mc1.20.4.jar","primary":true,"size":104805,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"4GyXKCLd","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.30+mc1.20.4.jar"},"mods\\player-animation-lib-fabric-1.0.2-rc1+1.20.jar":{"sha512":"4ed2659c9e9c1a1fa8936523f7d6de1b8012d8e06e6c58ef65ea5c7acef2b3a113afe584b3a31d70eee00423dbe533c06022cc5f169ab5a2ddf8167acf259ec8","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"gedNE4y2","slug":"playeranimator","project_type":"mod","team":"f913Xl1r","title":"playerAnimator","description":"animate the player","body":"# Player animation library,  \n## animate the player using keyframes.\n\n\nFor users/modpack devs, just put the jar into the mods folder.  \n\nFor mod developers, you may find more details [here -

Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter. Its system means that you'll never have a slot that's not used for anything, as mods request the slots they want.\n\nFor basic tutorials and comprehensive documentation, visit this project's [wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Home).\n","published":"2021-06-08T00:05:32.472592Z","updated":"2024-05-26T19:08:53.744849Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1295851,"followers":1031,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17-rc2","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["70Ajg5iP","dRgbv7A2","29Jd2Dm4","qpiOPBB9","R2UW6ejS","FdJA5sbK","DtvgyMK2","vOuy3Z5S","XqLNMi9J","WiXqMygm","oLUBJhyv","9qrmAiwv","OLwsMJv4","5zEAvqnX","A5kxdEY3","z8ProfKL","e563ycts","tJ23Vcff","AHxQGtuC","7aQD4OG8","SGjPO8H9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"AHxQGtuC","project_id":"5aaWibi9","author_id":"R6WsWKy9","featured":false,"name":"Trinkets 3.7.2","version_number":"3.7.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-11T04:25:11.224830Z","downloads":203711,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"bedf97c87c5e556416410267108ad358b32806448be24ef8ae1a79ac63b78b48b9c851c00c845b8aedfc7805601385420716b9e65326fdab21340e8ba3cc4274","sha1":"d58cc8759587f03f320f188972ca66baa788d008"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/versions/AHxQGtuC/trinkets-3.7.2.jar","filename":"trinkets-3.7.2.jar","primary":true,"size":238532,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"F0xlmrbH","user":{"id":"R6WsWKy9","username":"Emi","name":"Emi","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/14813658?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-10-26T21:52:52.726926Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"trinkets-3.7.2.jar"},"mods\\Chunky-1.3.146.jar":{"sha512":"9dbb82993302a8dfbe6ce1f46a051d72b5ada924424f4e23674ce660d209257584159a33248fa9247793e9ba03d3a117299ce1ff6685f06a7fb87c96504459aa","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"fALzjamp","slug":"chunky","project_type":"mod","team":"CohgUIPJ","title":"Chunky","description":"Pre-generates chunks, quickly and efficiently","body":"<h2>Chunky</h2>\n\nPre-generates chunks, quickly, efficiently, and safely\n\n<h3>Features</h3>\n\n- Start one or several chunk generation tasks at the same time (if you want to leverage your CPU more)\n- Pause chunk generation tasks, saving them for later\n- Shows detailed information such as chunks processed, percent to completion, ETA, chunk processing rate, etc\n- Custom world [shapes](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky/wiki/Shapes), and optional world border support with¬†[ChunkyBorder](https://modrinth.com/plugin/chunkyborder)¬†installed\n\n<h3>Permissions</h3>\n\nIn order to use chunky you will need to either:\n- Be an operator on a dedicated server.

height=\"59\" /><br />\n<b>An overhaul of the main End Island where the dragon fight takes place!</b>\n<p>Obsidian pillars, End gateways, the spawn platform, and the portal itself in the middle of the island have all been redesigned. Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b>¬†we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b>¬†Also note that¬†<b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config. Additionally, you can re-enable vanilla desert temples to spawn alongside Better Desert Temples in the config.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloser look: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpkTeTeDKJo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnimated trailer: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1C5Z0DaOQk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JR6R3uf.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Desert Temples is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Mineshafts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Dungeons\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Dungeons</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Bridges\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Bridges</a></li>\n<li>Repurposed Structures.

Another Config Lib, like, what were you expecting?\n  \n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n## Why does this mod even exist?\n\nThis mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2024-05-27T14:31:00.360011Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4179361,"followers":2461,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas","VPm1SrE4","RpevhOax","gJ6ZmZ4Z","Jf2pciI1","HM9McfrA","O7kIps9X","RBAUxw9P","4EU2xyVo","u6jV7Q7R","lVQpbXSe","3hsIB5yP","smEdHeFU","vede4iWJ","n8X2J9Hh","ZytICJS4","IHHNzQkV","3TfeWIWo","cwavYrLH","vMzBhYIk","StXMrAsz","5Y3n1Apc","DretS191","WdbHS4uT","elFOHmh9","R7WWpY0Z","G8Aq3OEv","WTCAdLsq","MJUxq3kq","LXUa8bFw","h61Z2iVZ","dLAG06tP","CL7AHQsm","HHrwznjQ","XNQUud9H","rsM9VY0D","bovSU7Mt","EkAJiIZH","lALu7fvN","TD5Fv92S","ePcFYsKB","hf7D9v77","8DXWiiaq","mkXoQQMn","ZHFdxhFP","hCwZI62j","sDwfolBP","G2PcCpZl","3jH5u49m","RXrT2ogA"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"RXrT2ogA","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"YetAnotherConfigLib 3.4.4 for MC 1.20.1","version_number":"3.4.4+1.20.1-fabric","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.4.4\n\nThis build supports the following versions:\n- Fabric 1.20.1\n- Fabric 1.20.4\n- Fabric 1.20.6 (also supports 1.20.5)\n- NeoForge 1.20.6 (also supports 1.20.5)\n- NeoForge 1.20.4\n- MinecraftForge 1.20.1\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- Fix Kotlin DSL not being included\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-27T14:31:01.933962Z","downloads":33379,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"010e9ca808de2172067ea1663cac27472e6dbbc76158e2b6808ee35b4f2b1decc9c4461c633b89d4357e66a2aaecf99c01f8b9c745192506ad06179fb251d672","sha1":"f2bbefc0279d3272fbda979702e8e0371b7ba01d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/versions/RXrT2ogA/YetAnotherConfigLib-3.4.4%2B1.20.1-fabric.jar","filename":"YetAnotherConfigLib-3.4.4+1.20.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":1072972,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nwpe87D0","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":"isXander","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer\n\nhttps://www.isxander.dev/","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"YetAnotherConfigLib-3.4.4+1.20.1-fabric.jar"},"mods\\ForgeConfigAPIPort-v8.0.0-1.20.1-Fabric.jar":{"sha512":"257cd85263ab5119ce78cf16f2e7fdaf8b350e526c758d00f0af8393b9fabd581a2a974096fc7c7af45d793660e2e7b84391e11d10522036759ec66220a4b616","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ohNO6lps","slug":"forge-config-api-port","project_type":"mod","team":"Lcr15WUK","title":"Forge Config API Port","description":"NeoForge's & Forge's config systems provided to other modding ecosystems.

[Keep a Changelog].\n\n## [v7.0.0-1.20] - 2023-06-09\n- Ported to Minecraft 1.20\n### Changed-\n- [Night Config](https://github.com/TheElectronWill/night-config) is now shaded instead of being included via Jar-in-Jar to allow it to be removed from `fabric.mod.json`, which was causing issues in developement environments when Night Config wasn't retrieved from the official Maven, but instead production jars were used, e.g. from the Curse Maven\n- Note that Night Config is shaded without being relocated to a different package, which is necessary to stay consistent with Forge\n### Removed\n- Removed deprecated classes in `net.minecraftforge.api` package\n\n[Keep a Changelog]:

Many mods utilize Bookshelf's code base to power their own mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Why use a library mod?</h3>\n<p>Library mods such as Bookshelf allow seemingly unrelated mods to share parts of the same code base. This reduces the amount of time and effort required to develop certain mods and features. The Library's code base is also tested in a wider range of circumstances and communities which can lead to less bugs and better performance in mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Features for Players</h3>\n<p>While this mod is primarily for mod authors, there are a few useful features for Players.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands</a> like /bookshelf hand to get item IDs.</li>\n<li>Many new <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs\" rel=\"nofollow\">datapack features</a> like crafting recipes that damage items with durability rather than consuming them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Features for Modders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/blob/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/serialization/Serializers.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serialization for JSON/Network/NBT formats.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/util\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utility Functions.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/registry\" rel=\"nofollow\">Registry manager, including non-forge registry types, debugging, and statistics.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#recipe-types\" rel=\"nofollow\">New recipe types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#ingredients\" rel=\"nofollow\">New ingredient types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#loot-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot condition types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#global-loot-modifiers\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot modifier types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#item-predicates\" rel=\"nofollow\">New item predicates.</a></li>\n<li>Check <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki</a> for more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft client, and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting systems on the client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will only remain effective on the client side if the server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of NoChatReports, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n\n## Installation and Usage:\n\nNoChatReports supports both Fabric and Forge, just download the version for your respective modloader and game version. It can be installed on either the client, server, or on both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present on:\n\n**1. Only Client:** The client will refuse to send the account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof that they were actually sent from your account. The server will relay them unless the `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to `true` in the `server.properties` file (which it is by default since 1.19.1)\n\nIf the server does require you to sign messages and you are on either 1.19.1 or 1.19.2, you will not be able to join the server unless you agree to send signed messages (NoChatReports will supply a warning screen), if you are on 1.19.3 or higher, you will still be able to join the server, but will not be able to use chat-related commands (other commands do still work)\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but the server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable the conversion of player to system messages in the config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\nAs of 1.20.2 the server cannot disable the \"unsigned messages\" warning on the client. It can only be disabled if the client has NoChatReports (or a similar mod) installed.\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signatures will be stripped on the client side before sending messages to the server, which will not attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough NoChatReports can function when it is only present on one of either sides, NoChatReports can be configured to demand itself to be installed on the respective other side in order to play. This way you can install it on the server and require all clients that join to have NoChatReports installed, but you can also leave it server-only if you prefer.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on the client, NoChatReports will disable Telemetry (similar to what [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make sure that your server is compatible with NoChatReports, you can take a look at [this part of the wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players).\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration files are located in the `NoChatReports` subfolder of the default config folder.\n\n`NCR-Client.json` stores Client-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Common.json` stores Server-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Encryption.json` stores Chat Encryption settings (Only effective on the client)\n\n`NCR-ServerPreferences.json` stores Per-Server Signing Modes\n\nYou can find more information [here](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/).\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to Chat Encryption, watching it will help you to learn how it is used (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features the following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make clients with No Chat Reports installed recognize servers running your software as safe. I wrote [a small article](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status) about this. For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

It currently powers *[Amethyst Imbuement](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/amethyst-imbuement)* and other upcoming mods in that family. While being magically themed, this library has a lot of other functionality too!\n\nSee the **[wiki](https://github.com/fzzyhmstrs/ac/wiki/Amethyst-Core-Home)** for more details, as well as the KDoc within the source.\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Banner](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/85a7141b-76c9-4f0c-bd04-21f4b0d56c4a.webp \"Bisect Hosting Banner\")](https://bisecthosting.com/fzzyhmstrs)\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;display:table\"> <span> <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Fnw2UbE72x\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img style=\"display:inline;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/iXATO6K.png\" width=\"265\" height=\"122\"></a> </span> <span> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emi\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img style=\"display:inline;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/U7qHdp4.png\" width=\"288\" height=\"108\"></a> </span> </span> </p>\n\nThere is a lot you can do with Amethyst Core, including but not limited to:\n* Implementing your own Modifier System; a parallel alternative to _Minecraft's_ Enchantment system\n* Creating extensions for _Amethyst Imbuement_\n* Creating distinct magic mods that have compatibility with _Amethyst Imbuement_\n* Implementing a consistent and auto-syncing configuration system\n* Building a magical wand with any number of abilities\n* Building modular _Trinkets_\n* Easily registering custom item models a la the Trident\n* Registering to a ticking Event Registry\n* Building and registering additions to loot tables easily\n* Spawn particles that track the player and visually appear where desired on the player's screen\n* Register persistent effects that you want to trigger over time without needing to track the effect within custom ticking code\n\nAnd much more!\n\n## Modifiers\nThe [Modifier Framework](https://github.com/fzzyhmstrs/ac/wiki/Modifier-Framework) is a flexible and extensible system designed as a parallel to the vanilla Enchanting system. Modifiers aim to solve two of the biggest problems I found with Enchanting: They are easily removable, and they do not internalize their functionality (besides a couple damage methods). Enchantments are also more boring than they could be, displaying their tier with a simple number. Modifiers aim to fix all of those issues!\n* Modifiers are designed to be permanent, acting more like affixes. Grindstones can't remove them, for example.\n* Modifiers internalize their functions, and can be called as one unit rather than piecemeal.\n* Modifiers act via a \"family tree\" that allow for flavorful tiers. Think of a sword going from \"Rusty\" to \"Shiny\" to \"Gleaming\" etc. \n\n_The library comes with builtin helper method for displaying modifiers_\n![An example tooltip with modifiers shown in gold text](https://i.imgur.com/49MU0vx.png)\n\nSee the wiki link above for more details on these features. Once implemented, a Modifier system can do just about anything. _Amethyst Cores_ built-in `AugmentModifier` does things from affecting mana cost and cooldown, to changing spell damage or range, to even triggering advanced effects like afflicting every mob in a 12 block radius around the caster with Wither upon any successful spell cast.\n\nModifers can be as simple as a container for passing vanilla `AttributeModifiers`, or much more complex than the `AugmentModifier` described above. They could even be used purely for flavor, if desired!\n\n## Magic Mod Utilities\n_Amethyst Core_ contains everything you need to develop a magic-themed mod in the style of _Amethyst Imbuement_. The library, however, does not include any crafting or progression systems. This is up to you! YOu can either follow along exactly how _Amethyst Imbuement_ does, with imbuing recipes, and tiered augments in scepters, or craft your own unique systems. Blood rituals maybe? Nature-themed magic? Sky's the limit.\n\n#### Scepters\nA framework for building a wide array of _Amethyst Imbuement_ style Scepters is included, from the most barebone `AbstractScepterItem` you can take almost any direction, to a `DefaultScepterItem` that is almost fully implemented for creating an _Amethyst Imbuement_ compatible Scepter(s) of your own.\n\n#### Augments\nBuild enhanced enchantments either for use with Scepters, or for adding to trinkets and equipment. Utilities for advanced functionality like passive ticking effects, effects on equip, etc.\n\n#### Trinkets\nUtilities for building _Trinket_ compatible items that can utilize the Augment system. As seen in _Amethyst Imbuement_, this allows for modular trinkets and items that aren't limited to predefined benefits.\n\n#### Mana-based Items\nInterfaces and utilities for developing an item that uses \"mana\" instead of durability. Items won't break at minimum durability, they can be easily \"healed\" and there is a Helper for auto-healing (mana regeneration). Items can also be checked to see if a certain action is possible with the current mana in the item.\n\n## And Much More!\nLook through the wiki and source code documentation for all that _Amethyst Core_ has to offer!","published":"2022-07-04T16:43:23.847069Z","updated":"2024-04-22T04:44:52.634978Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":135553,"followers":29,"categories":["library","magic","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["FjMwbsHS","3C9vBGk9","5DFmIITp","pvo6Xo2r","FPgkzHD6","aLExolfh","XwsS3Ofm","3Dq4xDvZ","d75c3WjJ","Tzp1fOCT","NL6ZIaUo","5LNeeIQx","AhttwmD6","YYiXIev8","dSRLDg9K","YxgppL8v","FLqXjE5V","NzNu6fBE","XjI6Fv2S","O725Kopd","a85TXfbU","gnUwjEjE","ijClAwFi","Bt3K3p8R","5CNeiXs4","M4fQbGln","X4AkNOor","AxFx5Kp2","u80Mo3UX","3MOMdP5T","KMD7sKYP","fX0pUENW","MIUQqJfD","nuIP2J55","yy7A8tMy","RfWqQw7J","Zxk0aM4c","cbhOhDEN","2zxR8CsT","yQdDZuoO","NPRNbGh4","RBLQv1WT","jnPQxOOy","TP4AUleU","5MXxGGTr","xQbvrcqd","KxkJzNyp","8FDxnm1z","jSuSsyUp","vtlc7Jss","NjxYldIz","9cevX8EL","tJy3tENx","Jg3fDiNM","dIS3w9bA","119UIa6T","L0fUUZZf","uOfYAfvv","rYhm8Fz6","vsVzkKGk","RipyFwPZ","dVyJOTFl","MHAf9gTF","WFCau6eG","bnGF6W3L","gYjup7So","NogHbKzH","t3Tks6iD"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/UbOpZw7q/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"t3Tks6iD","project_id":"UbOpZw7q","author_id":"ANKRvkxl","featured":false,"name":"Amethyst Core 1.5.0+1.20.1","version_number":"1.5.0+1.20.1","changelog":"Update to new Fzzy Config release implementation.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-22T04:44:53.107040Z","downloads":3777,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"19f5e8fb0d6ecf9b89fa164734e4db7f83428288","sha512":"073c629e51404b16c332429bbd12e7a600f385f7ce6392804259621bc8004775a42ac0d8f6b24d7d383508efd2bc21074cba3fb3590615f42c7b0e2067f649c1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/UbOpZw7q/versions/t3Tks6iD/amethyst_core-1.5.0%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"amethyst_core-1.5.0+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":350969,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"LJ5wlCDr","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"hYykXjDp","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"TD12RbBp","user":{"id":"ANKRvkxl","username":"fzzyhmstrs","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72876796?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-13T21:42:13.876320Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"amethyst_core-1.5.0+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\PuzzlesLib-v8.1.20-1.20.1-Fabric.jar":{"sha512":"d7f04c01deeb9e1fe685c0d9464da3ad83ff3dbab919e27bfce2ed2be765fa15107c20d413705eebc97b0f46fc403928132bbacb5df302196b661b3c3c006a11","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"QAGBst4M","slug":"puzzles-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"ubZOU9rM","title":"Puzzles Lib","description":"Why's it called Puzzles you ask?

Backpack","description":"Unique and upgradeable backpacks with customisation, Curios API/Trinkets integration and more!","body":"## Traveler's Backpack\n...is a Minecraft mod, which adds unique **backpacks**. The mod is a successor of **[JavierDarkona](https://www.curseforge.com/members/darkona/projects)'s**¬†**Adventure Backpack** and since 1.16 all textures have been completely remade to fit the new style. Furthermore, functionality of backpack has been expanded by various new features. Traveler's Backpack is the [official port](https://i.imgur.com/Su1JySt.png).\n\n![travelers backpack text](https://i.imgur.com/OwJ2twO.png)\n\n[![Discord badge](https://img.shields.io/discord/724696823276503210?color=542c14&amp;labelColor=261509&amp;label=&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white&amp;style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/f8Nnj5VuFj) [![Github badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Github&amp;color=542c14&amp;labelColor=261509&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Tiviacz1337/Travelers-Backpack) [![Wiki badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Wiki&amp;color=542c14&amp;labelColor=261509&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Tiviacz1337/Travelers-Backpack/wiki)  [![Patreon badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Donate&amp;color=542c14&amp;labelColor=261509&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=paypal)](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=KE52UJ7TAZAC4) [![Paypal badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Become%20My%20Patron&amp;color=542c14&amp;labelColor=261509&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=patreon&amp;logoColor=white)](https://www.patreon.com/tiviacz1337)\n\n![travelers backpack bar](https://i.imgur.com/xjdqPMI.png)\n\n- **Full inventory? No more!**\n\nUpgraded backpack can provide about¬†**63 inventory slots**¬†and¬†**2 fluid tanks**, each of which can store up to 7 buckets of fluid or even 28 bottles of potion (Now even more, since it's configurable!). All inventory slots and tanks can be accessed via external pipes. The backpack also provides special buttons - **sort**, **quick stack** and **transfer**¬†to seamlessly manage inventory!\n\n- **Tier Upgrades**\n\nBackpack has to be¬†**upgraded**¬†to reach its maximum storage and tank capacity. Upgrading can be done at a¬†**smithing table** by placing a leather in template slot, tier upgrade and a backpack in next slots. Although the backpack can't be directly upgraded to the Netherite tier, it has to be upgraded to all lower tiers first. To reset backpack upgrades and settings, place the backpack on the ground and Shift + Right-click while holding a Blank Upgrade in your hand.\n\n- **Chestplate or backpack? Why not both?**\n\nTraveler's backpack doesn't need any empty armor slot (or other slot, unless Curios/Trinkets integration is enabled) to be worn. The player can wear one backpack on their back at a time and its inventory can be accessed via the **B** (Configurable) button.\n\n- **The best gear for adventures!**\n\nCrafting Table is your bestfriend? Equip your backpack with Crafting Upgrade! Unroll the sleeping bag whenever you want! Don't worry, you won't lose your spawn point! Also it's worth taking advantage of handy tool slots (Tool swapping described on Wiki). The fluid tanks, in combination with Hose Item (Hose functioning described on Wiki) provide good portable fluid storage.\n\n- **Customization that you have never seen!**\n\nChoose your personal style from over 45 custom backpacks, which represent various creatures and blocks. As if that weren't enough, some of them can provide special abilities! 1.16+ versions provide **dyed backpack**. You can combine whichever dyes you want to create a unique look!\n\n![end travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/E1YYiRf.png)\n\n## Backpacks and Inventory Preview\n<details>\n<summary>Click</summary>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8wR8Thg.png\" alt=\"all backpacks showcase\" height=\"650\" width = \"584\"/>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/c9Ojonb.gif\" width=\"584\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fmjcSej.gif\" width=\"584\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n\n</details>\n\n![bee travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/HpldKTS.png)\n\n*** \n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/np93li4.png\" alt=\"kinetic hosting banner\" width=\"800\" height=\"281\"/>](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=102)\n\n## Modpacks\nYou are allowed to use this mod in public/private modpacks.

elements of tech are designed to leave as many design choices to the player as possible. With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>\n<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing a Recipe Viewer mod. Create has full support for <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\">JEI</a>, <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/rei\">REI</a>, and <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emi\">EMI</a>. The vanilla recipe book will not be able to guide you through the experience by itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a

When you kill bosses in this mod adds or the vanilla ones, namely the Wither or Ender Dragon, they will now drop a Lord Soul item, which you can use to craft most of the legendary weapons this mod adds. The mod is highly configurable through the config file. You can change everything from boss health, damage to weapon damage and ability cooldowns.\n\nThe weapons come from many different places, ranging from Norse mythology, the imagination, or other game titles. A list of all the weapons added can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/mariumbacchus/Soulslike-Weaponry/wiki/Weapons-&-Armor\">in the wiki</a>, some of them include:\n- Bloodthirster, Comet Spear and the Darkin Blade from League of Legends\n- Moonlight Short/Greatsword, Dragonslayer Swordspear and Forlorn Scythe from Dark Souls\n- Blunderbuss, Gatling Gun, Whirligig Sawblade and Hunter Cannon from Bloodborne\n- Sword of Freyr, Mj√∂lnir and Skofnung from Norse Mythology\n- and more!\n\nThe mod also includes a parry mechanic with the shields and a posture meter that applies Posture Break effect on the target when filled. Guns and the Stagger enchant applies posture loss that fills this meter.\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mariumbacchus/Soulslike-Weaponry/wiki/Bosses\">Bosses</a>:\n\n- The Decaying King\n     - The Decaying King lives in the throne room of the demon city, the last remains of the ancient civilization from the nether after the entire civilization collapsed into the lava sea. This cursed monstrosity wields The Darkin Blade, and has many deadly attacks to look out for. Killing it makes it drop the Darkin Blade, a Lord Soul and the Withered Demon Heart.\n- Old Champion's Remains\n     - A boss living in the Old Champion's Graves, this skeleton figure has been possessed by another being, namely The Frenzied Shade. The Old Champion will switch between a defensive state behind his shield and an aggressive state by relentlessly swinging at you with his sword. After killing the Old Champion, it will drop the Draugr sword, and the Frenzied Shade will emerge. This creature is the one possessing the Lord Soul, so make sure to stay alert when killing the Old Champion!\n- The Returning Knight\n     - The Returning Knight is a slow, but hard hitting boss with a few attacks up his sleeve. First of all, all projectiles around him will have no effect on him, and will rather be reflected back in the direction they came from, so be careful with that Hunter Cannon! At half health, he will use his last forces of moonlight to be Unbreakable, slamming his arm on his chest, gaining Resistance. After killing The Returning Knight, he will drop moonstone, Nightfall, a Lord Soul and the Arkenstone.\n- Fallen Icon\n     - By using the Essence of Eventide on the Old Moon Altar, you will return the true essence back to it's original body. This will result in the summoning of the Fallen Icon, a fierce empowered version of the Returning Knight with a fast and dangerous second phase. When summoned, Unbreakable will be used right away, affecting all nearby players with Weakness, Nausea and Slowness. The boss does not get any bonus Resistance unlike Returning Knight, and since the true soul has been returned to the vessel, some of the dark power has been slightly suppressed, making the boss unable to reflect projectiles, but it is still immune to them! Upon it's death, the Arkenstone will shatter, and it will instead drop the Essence of Luminescence, the crafting recipe for creating the Pure Moonlight Greatsword.\n- Monarch of Chaos\n     - The Monarch of Chaos is a powerful mage wielding the accursed wand, the Withered Wabbajack. Additionally, it wears both the Crown of Chaos and the Cape of Chaos, two items that that will be dropped upon it's death with the Withered Wabbajack. It can be summoned by using the Shard of Uncertainty (which is dropped by the Wither) on the Blackstone Pedestal block. The Monarch of Chaos is a fast attacking and chaotic boss, hence it's name, having it's attack cooldown reduced lower and lower based on it's missing health. Thanks to the Cape of Chaos, it turns all Grass Blocks around it into Withered Grass Blocks, which will continuously inflict the Decay status effect on all entities standing on them. On non-player entities, they will also take high Wither damage, while players will have their armor quickly deteriorate and fall apart, meanwhile thanks to the Crown of Chaos, the boss itself will heal small amounts on this zone.\n- Day Stalker & Night Prowler\n     - A fierce duo boss representing day and night. They are both empowered based on whether it is daytime or nighttime, and will each switch between flying above the target and being on the ground. Upon killing one of them, the other will become empowered, entering a challenging phase two.","published":"2023-03-24T19:00:03.759253Z","updated":"2024-05-13T18:30:08.037762Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":219757,"followers":160,"categories":["adventure","equipment","mobs"],"additional_categories":["worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["kC0tqpza","PfIuVgK8","BE8X9qmS","4KUFg6ED","7AA16Ilh","fF2upsNN","WpYbwBb7","bbvZDVhF","hb3CIc58","3hYuwbTT","RMoYysfr","i352JlgK","hOVG4wCW","yu7EMHuy","R9PriATS","NHZIP93n","eHwZmtHq","a07x6LCo","7h8LRaKG","GGvxee8c","LzOSLCC2","gSZ3DFYM","EBQSEiFA","kYBGrRfI","EeDvXKwi","Ya3uMd8M","rjgmOoJ4","80vueSBC"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/oX6SohLj/273f845965c0aaa9a67a01803914facdd42d5bbb.png"},"version":{"id":"EeDvXKwi","project_id":"oX6SohLj","author_id":"A8tRJfFh","featured":true,"name":"SW 1.1.3 [1.20/1.20.1]","version_number":"1.1.3-1.20-fabric","changelog":"Changelog:\n\n- Bosses entering phase 2 will clear all their effects, both good and bad ones (mainly targeted towards Cursed Wounds preventing healing when initiating phase 2)\n- Fixed issues regarding sounds not playing dynamically from the block position/entity they are played from\n- Added a cap in the config for the amount of allies/summons which can be summoned for each summon weapon (i.e Nightfall, Soulreaper, etc.)\n- Improved Fallen Icon's Core Beam attack with new particle logic and an actual beam render","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-07T11:19:17.538100Z","downloads":27791,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0c6bb84a1ac5222b28d0541dbd8348799333741bb8fe232287ea6f50cb802149b50d8d8af02297235ebd7c06da694f0cf0c5efd7e5a71e029e2dc3959ea3207f","sha1":"fdd29e6dae01a38184fdbec6af1944ecc7f0fcb2"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/oX6SohLj/versions/EeDvXKwi/soulslike-weaponry-1.1.3-1.20-fabric.jar","filename":"soulslike-weaponry-1.1.3-1.20-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":6239036,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"8BmcQJ2H","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"lOOpEntO","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"bXjGYdNw","user":{"id":"A8tRJfFh","username":"mariumbacchus","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125290169?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-03-24T18:59:01.045348Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"soulslike-weaponry-1.1.3-1.20-fabric.jar"},"mods\\BetterF3-7.0.2-Fabric-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"1b1f5bae45050bf01a23c57cfe94b7f42c6e0e9d669150effc04d3d09fd43c2dbea6c634117309ab1ee11253fcdb3c6061a9034e963b7f08476a76f1e98c3b8a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"8shC1gFX","slug":"betterf3","project_type":"mod","team":"uWJ0gwSz","title":"BetterF3","description":"BetterF3 is a mod that replaces Minecraft's original debug HUD with a highly customizable, more human-readable HUD.","body":"# BetterF3 \n![Environment: Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/environment-client-1976d2?style=flat-square)\n\n#### BetterF3 is a mod that replaces Minecraft's original debug HUD with a highly customizable, more human-readable HUD.

This is required for Simply Skills to generate files. (Not needed for 1.20+ versions)**\n\n### **Features**\n\nSimply Skills provides a combat oriented skill tree for Fabric, complete with unique passive skills, specialisations, and signature abilities.\n\nDriven by a vision to enrich combat encounters within Minecraft, Simply Skills harnesses the power of the  [Spell Engine](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spell-engine)  &  [Spell Power Attributes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spell-power)  framework (created by Daedelus). By adopting this framework, players are empowered with distinctive skill sets that enable them to stand out among their peers and fully immerse themselves in the class fantasy they desire.\n\n#### **- Passive Skills -**\n\nUnlike the typical stat increase nodes on the tree, Passive Skills provide you with unique passive abilities that alter game mechanics in unique and meaningful ways.\n\n#### **- Specialisations -**\n\nSpecialisations can be unlocked by working your way through the base skill tree, until you reach a specialisation path. Once a specialisation path has been chosen, you will unlock an additional seperate skill tree that contains abilities and skills unique to your chosen specialisation. You may only have one specialisation unlocked at a time.\n\n#### **- Signature Abilities -**\n\nSignature Abilities, unlocked by advancing to a specialisation path, provide you with unique active abilities that can help to turn the tide of battle. These abilities can often be further enhanced and customised via passive nodes in the relevant specialisation skill tree. Due to their power, these abilities have an internal cooldown. (default keybind 'V')\n\n#### **- Respecialisation -**\n\nYour base skill tree can be reset by using a Malevolent Manuscript. This will refund all points spent in the tree.  \nIf you have a specialisation unlocked at the time of use, this will also erase all points spent within the specialisation tree. The points lost will be gone forever, so choose carefully.\n\n### **Roadmap**\nSubject to change\n\nQ4 2023: Ascendancy Tree\n- Additional late-game player progression\n\nQ1 2024: Additional Specialisations\n- Necromancer & Shaman\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWant to play with Simply Skills on a server with friends?
